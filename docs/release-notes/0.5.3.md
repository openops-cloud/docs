Release 0.5.3 (2025-10-06)

### New Features
- **AI Authentication & Configuration**: Users can now configure AI provider credentials—including provider, model, API key, and advanced settings—with built-in validation (`aiAuth` feature).
- **Analyze Action for AI Blocks**: Introduces an “Analyze” action allowing workflows to pose questions or perform analysis via an LLM with customizable inputs.
- **Chat Model & Provider Management**: Save, update, and select language models and providers within AI chat contexts through new API endpoints and dynamic UI components.

### Bug Fixes
- **JSON Editor Height**: Restored the original editor height by re-applying the `mih-h` class.
- **Step Settings Stability**: Prevented unnecessary remounts when creating draft versions by correcting the flow container key.
- **AI Auth & Validation**: Fixed provider–model compatibility checks, improved auth validation when saving connections, and resolved inconsistencies in AI chat context state (restoring “Generate with AI” functionality).
- **Error Messaging**: Standardized frontend error parsing by converting non-string error objects into strings for consistent display.
- **Outlook Email Selection**: Ensured email selection works in Outlook by refreshing auth requirements for reply actions.

### Performance Improvements
- **Accurate Workflow Duration**: Refined duration calculation to accumulate total runtime—including pauses—for more precise metrics.
- **Dynamic Connections**: Enhanced performance of connections selection outside of step settings with faster dynamic value handling.
- **Higher LLM Call Limit**: Increased the default cap on unattended LLM calls from 20 to 100.
- **Faster Validation & Input Resolution**: Leveraged Zod schemas for variable validation and improved input resolution with robust error handling.
- **Font Loading Optimization**: Inlined `@font-face` declarations into CSS to eliminate extra stylesheet requests and speed up load times.

### Enhancements
- **Session Persistence**: Detects session expiry client-side and redirects users back to their last visited page after re-login.
- **Action Approval Controls**: Introduced `requireToolApproval` flags across multiple actions to enforce review or authorization as needed.
- **UI Spacing Fix**: Resolved inconsistent spacing between successive tool calls by adjusting margin classes.
