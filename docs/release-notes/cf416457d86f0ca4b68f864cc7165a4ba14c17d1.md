# Use flow id from builder state context to decouple from route definition (October 7, 2025)

### Improvements

- Decouple `useFlowUpdates` hook from route parameters: now accepts a `flowId` argument instead of reading from the URL.
- Remove dependency on `useParams` from `react-router-dom`.
- Update BuilderPage to pass the `flowId` from the builder state context.
