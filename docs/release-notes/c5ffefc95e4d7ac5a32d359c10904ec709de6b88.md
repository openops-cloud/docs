Release: Add model selector to “Ask AI” action (2025-10-06)

### New Features
- Added a `model` dropdown property to the `askAi` action: users can now select an AI model at the action level with dynamic options based on the connected provider.
- Updated model selection logic to prioritize the action-level model over the connection default.
- Improved prompt construction by joining additional inputs correctly without unnecessary JSON stringification.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed validation requirements for the `model` property and corrected the variable name from `overridenModel` to `overridingModel` for consistency.

### Refactorings & Improvements
- Simplified imports and the authentication object structure in `askAi` for better maintainability.
- Removed redundant dynamic imports and unnecessary type assertions to clean up the codebase.
