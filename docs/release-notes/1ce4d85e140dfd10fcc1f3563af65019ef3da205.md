Release Title: Fix markdown property flickering in block settings

Release Date: October 7th, 2025

### Performance Improvements

- Prevent flickering of markdown properties in block settings by memoizing the `markdownVariables` object using `React.useMemo`, stabilizing its reference and avoiding unnecessary re-renders. Dependencies include `webhookPrefixUrl`, `frontendUrl`, and `flowId`. ([OPS-2727](https://linear.app/openops/issue/OPS-2727/cant-select-code-inside-markdown-properties))
