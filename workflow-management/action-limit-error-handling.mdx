This page describes how OpenOps (Beta) handles and notifies you when a workflow run exceeds the configured action limit, including error alerts and next steps for troubleshooting by practitioners and platform administrators.

## Background

OpenOps enforces a limit on the number of actions that can execute in a single workflow run. This helps ensure platform stability and prevents runaway automations. When a workflow exceeds this configured limit, an error is triggered and surfaced in the user interface.

## How the Error Appears

When the action execution limit is reached:

- The workflow halts further execution immediately
- The UI displays a prominent alert message using the `TestRunActionLimitReachedPlate` component
- The alert message describes that the maximum allowed number of actions for a single workflow run has been reached
- The alert typically includes:
  - Reference to the configured action limit
  - Suggestion to review step logic or contact an administrator to raise the threshold
  - Link or label to configure the limit ("Configure limit") if permitted by user role

**Example UI Alert:**

```
⚠️ Action limit reached
This workflow run has reached the maximum number of allowed actions (e.g., 100). No further actions will be executed. To raise this limit, contact your administrator or adjust the configuration.
```

## User Actions

If you encounter this error as a workflow user:

1. Review your workflow for loops or excessive parallel branches that may exceed the expected number of steps.
2. If the limit is too low for your use case, contact your OpenOps administrator to change the configuration.
3. Use the "Configure limit" interface (when visible) to request or suggest a new limit.

## Troubleshooting

- **Expected outcome**: The platform blocks any further action execution and surfaces a clear, dismissible alert.
- **If the alert does not appear**: Refresh the page or check workflow logs for error details.
- **If you need to raise the limit**: Only users with administrative permissions can adjust action limits. See your organization's OpenOps admin or [User Management](/getting-started/user-management).
