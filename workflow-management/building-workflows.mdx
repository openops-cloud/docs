title: 'Building Workflows From Scratch'
description: 'TODO'
---

In many cases, you can apply optimizations by taking one of the pre-made [workflow templates](workflow-templates), creating a workflow off of the template, and [customizing it](customizing-workflows) to your liking.

When there's no template to bootstrap from, you can create a new workflow from scratch.

In order to end up with a minimal usable workflow, you need to:
1. [Create a new workflow](#creating-a-new-workflow)
2. [Add a trigger](#adding-a-trigger)
3. [Add at least one action](#adding-an-action)
4. [Publish the workflow](#publishing-a-workflow)

Triggers and actions are the two basic building blocks of every workflow:
* A **trigger** is your workflow's starting point. It defines how often your workflow executes. It may also represent an event that needs to occur for your workflow to kick off. A workflow always has exactly one trigger.
* **Actions** define the steps of your workflow that start executing once your workflow is activated by a trigger.

Below is an example of a workflow that is triggered on a schedule. The first node represents the schedule trigger, and all other nodes are actions:

![Workflow triggered on a schedule](/images/workflow-trigger-schedule.png)

In a different example, here's a workflow that uses an update of a Jira Cloud issue as a trigger:

![Workflow triggered by a Jira Cloud issue update](/images/workflow-trigger-jira.png)

## Creating a new workflow

To create a new empty workflow, go to the **Flows** section in your OpenOps instance, and click **New Flow** in the top right corner. What's you'll see is the workflow editor that initially looks like this:

![Empty workflow editor](/images/workflow-editor-empty.png)

Let's look around and see what controls the editor provides you with:
* In the top left corner, if you click the error next to the folder name, you get access to a menu that lets you **rename** the new workflow, **delete** it, or **move to a folder** for better organization:
![Workflow editor controls](/images/workflow-editor-controls.png)
* The icon to the left of the workflow name is a switch that lets you **show or hide the sidebar** containing the main OpenOps navigation menu.
* To the right of the workflow name, you have several buttons: **Tree view**, **Version history**, **Run logs** and **Notes**. Version history and run logs will be more relevant when you [update](/workflow-management/customizing-workflows) or [troubleshoot](/workflow-management/investigate-workflow-run) your workflows later on. For now, you can use **Notes** to describe the intent of your workflow in detail or leave any other comments. You can also click **Tree view** to display an aside showing the compact structure of your workflow, including its trigger, all actions, as well as [conditions and branches](/workflow-management/scheduling-conditional-branching):
![Tree view of a workflow](/images/workflow-editor-tree-view.png)

## Adding a trigger

When you create a new workflow, the editor creates a stub trigger that is empty. Click the trigger node to select a trigger group that works for you:
![Selecting a trigger group](/images/workflow-editor-select-trigger-group.png)

After selecting a group, select a specific trigger within that group:
![Selecting a trigger](/images/workflow-editor-select-trigger.png)

OpenOps provides over 20 triggers divided into a few groups:
* **Schedule**: *Every X minutes*, *Every hour*, *Every day*, *Every week*, *Every month*, *Cron expression*.
* **SFTP**: *New file*.
* **Webhook**: *Catch webhook*.
* **Slack**: *New message*, *New reaction*.
* **Jira Cloud**: *New issue*, *Updated issue*.
* **Monday.com**: *New item in board*, *Specific column value updated in board*.
* **Square**: *New order*, *Order updated*, *New customer*, *Customer updated*, *New appointment*, *New payment*, *New invoice*.

Some triggers are used more often than others. For most of your scenarios, you will probably use one of the triggers in the **Schedule** group, setting your workflows to run at a predetermined interval.

Curiously, out of all the workflow templates currently available in the [templates catalog](/workflow-management/workflow-templates), 23 templates use the *Every day* trigger, three templates use a different kind of schedule-based trigger, and two more templates trigger off an update to a Jira Cloud issue.

After selecting a trigger, click the trigger node again to display a right-hand pane with the properties of the trigger. For example, here are properties of the *Every day* trigger:
![Trigger properties](/images/workflow-editor-trigger-properties.png)

You can choose a specific hour in a specific time zone and include weekends, or go with the reasonable defaults.

Properties will vary with each kind of trigger. For example, if the trigger is a new issue in Jira Cloud, you can specify a search query using Jira's JQL query language.

## Adding an action

As soon as you've created a trigger, you can add your first action by clicking the **+** icon under the trigger.

OpenOps provides 120+ actions that are roughly

* **Code**: write custom code in TypeScript or JavaScript
* **Loop on items**: iterate over a list of items from a previous step
* **Data mapper**: map data from one format to another
* **Date operations**
* **Delay**
* **End Workflow**
* **File operations**: create or read files
* **List operations**: process a list that is an output of another action by grouping, mapping, or extracting values
* **Math operations**: arithmetic operations, averaging, returning minimum and maximums, generating random numbers
* **Text operations**: concatenate, split, find and replace text; convert from HTML to Markdown and vice versa
* **HTTP**: send a request and get a response
* **SFTP**: create or read files
* **OpenOps Tables**: manage records in [tables](TODO link)
* **Storage**: manage data in your OpenOps installation's own storage (TODO verify)
* Cloud provider integrations
    * **AWS**: multiple actions around AWS resources such as EC2, EBS, and RDS
    * **Azure**: execute Azure CLI commands
* Recommendation service integrations
    * **Anodot**: get recommendations from Anadot, manage comments and user status
    * **AWS Compute Optimizer**: get recommendations
* IaC integrations
    * **AWS CloudFormation**: manage templates and resources
    * **Terraform**: update or delete resources
* Other integrations
    * **GitHub**: get file content, create a PR, or trigger a GitHub Actions run
    * **Jira Cloud**: search, create, or update an issue or an issue comment
    * **Monday.com**: managing boards, groups, columns, and items
    * **AWS Athena**: send queries to Athena databases





To explore in other articles:
* **Condition**: split the workflow into exactly two branches based on a condition (conditional branching)
* **Split**: split the workflow into multiple branches based on a condition (conditional branching)
* **Approval**: request approval with or without pausing the workflow (human in the loop)
* **Slack**: send an update messages, request and wait for user actions (human in the loop)
* **SMTP**: send emails

When you've finished creating and chaining actions in your workflow, remember to add one last action that every workflow should conclude with: the *End Workflow* action.
