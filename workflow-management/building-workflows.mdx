In many cases, you can apply optimizations by taking one of the pre-made [workflow templates](workflow-templates), creating a flow off of the template, and [customizing it](customizing-workflows) to your liking.

When there's no template to bootstrap from, you can create a new flow from scratch.

To do this, go to the **Flows** section in your OpenOps instance, and click **New Flow** in the upper right corner. What's you'll see is the flow editor that initially looks like this:

In order to create a minimal working flow, you need to:
1. Add a trigger.
2. Add at least one action.
3. Publish the flow.

Triggers and actions are the two basic building blocks of every flow:
* A **trigger** is your flow's starting point. It defines how often your flow executes. It may also represent an event that needs to occur for your flow to kick off. A flow always has exactly one trigger.
* **Actions** define the steps of your flow that start executing once your flow is activated by a trigger.

There are various types of triggers available, such as Schedule Trigger, Webhook Trigger, or Event Trigger based on specific service.

There's a variety of actions, such as running code or communicating with other services.

In real-life scenario:
