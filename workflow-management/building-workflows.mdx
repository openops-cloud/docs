title: 'Building Workflows From Scratch'
description: 'TODO'
---

In many cases, you can apply optimizations by taking one of the pre-made [workflow templates](workflow-templates), creating a workflow off of the template, and [customizing it](customizing-workflows) to your liking.

When there's no template to bootstrap from, you can create a new workflow from scratch.

In order to end up with a minimal usable workflow, you need to:
1. [Create a new workflow](#creating-a-new-workflow)
2. [Add a trigger](#adding-a-trigger)
3. [Add at least one action](#adding-an-action)
4. [Publish the workflow](#publishing-a-workflow)

Triggers and actions are the two basic building blocks of every workflow:
* A **trigger** is your workflow's starting point. It defines how often your workflow executes. It may also represent an event that needs to occur for your workflow to kick off. A workflow always has exactly one trigger.
* **Actions** define the steps of your workflow that start executing once your workflow is activated by a trigger.

Below is an example of a workflow that is triggered on a schedule. The first node represents the schedule trigger, and all other nodes are actions:

In a different example, here's a workflow that uses an update of a Jira Cloud issue as a trigger:

## Creating a new workflow

To create a new empty workflow, go to the **Flows** section in your OpenOps instance, and click **New Flow** in the top right corner. What's you'll see is the workflow editor that initially looks like this:

![Empty workflow editor](/images/workflow-editor-empty.png)

Let's look around and see what controls the editor provides you with:
* In the top left corner, if you click the error next to the folder name, you get access to a menu that lets you **rename** the new workflow, **delete** it, or **move to a folder** for better organization:
![Workflow editor controls](/images/workflow-editor-controls.png)
* The icon to the left of the workflow name is a switch that lets you **show or hide the sidebar** containing the main OpenOps navigation menu.
* To the right of the workflow name, you have several buttons: **Tree view**, **Version history**, **Run logs** and **Notes**. Version history and run logs will be more relevant when you [update](/workflow-management/customizing-workflows) or [troubleshoot](/workflow-management/investigate-workflow-run) your workflows later on. For now, you can use **Notes** to describe the intent of your workflow in detail or leave any other comments. You can also click **Tree view** to display an aside showing the compact structure of your workflow, including its trigger, all actions, as well as [conditions and branches](/workflow-management/scheduling-conditional-branching):

## Adding a trigger

Core triggers:
* Schedule
    * Every X minutes
    * Every hour
    * Every day
    * Every week
    * Every month
    * Cron expression
* SFTP
    * New file (when a new file is created or modified)
* Webhook
    * Catch webhook (receive webhooks using any HTTP methods)

App triggers:
* Jira Cloud
    * New issue
    * Updated issue
* Monday.com
    * New item in board
    * Specific column value updated in board
* Slack
    * New message
    * New reaction
* Square
    * New order
    * Order updated
    * New customer
    * Customer updated
    * New appointment
    * New payment
    * New invoice

Triggers used in templates catalog:
* 2x Jira Cloud: Updated issue
* Schedule: Every hour
* Schedule: Every week
* 21x Schedule: Every day
* Schedule: Every day, Mon to Fri at 8AM
* Schedule: Every monday morning
* Schedule: Every day at 6PM

There are various types of triggers available, such as Schedule Trigger, Webhook Trigger, or Event Trigger based on specific service.

## Adding an action

There's a variety of actions, such as running code or communicating with other services.

Every workflow should end with the *End Workflow* action.
