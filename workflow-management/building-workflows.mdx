title: 'Building Workflows From Scratch'
description: 'How to use the OpenOps workflow editor to create new workflows'
---

In many cases, you can apply optimizations by taking one of the pre-made [workflow templates](workflow-templates), creating a workflow off of the template, and [customizing it](customizing-workflows) to your liking.

When there's no template to bootstrap from, you can create a new workflow from scratch.

To end up with a minimally usable workflow, you need to:
1. [Create a new workflow](#creating-a-new-workflow)
2. [Add a trigger](#adding-a-trigger)
3. [Add at least one action](#adding-an-action)
4. [Publish the workflow](#publishing-a-workflow)

Every workflow is made of steps. There are **two types of workflow steps**: triggers and actions.
* A **trigger** is your workflow's first step. It defines how often your workflow executes. It may also represent an event that needs to occur for your workflow to kick off. A workflow always has exactly one trigger.
* **Actions** are all subsequent steps of your workflow that start executing once your workflow is activated by a trigger.

Below is an example of a workflow that is triggered on a schedule. The first node represents the schedule trigger, and all other nodes are actions:

In another example, here's a workflow that uses an update of a Jira Cloud issue as a trigger:

![Workflow triggered by a Jira Cloud issue update](/images/workflow-trigger-jira.png)

## Creating a new workflow

To create a new empty workflow, go to the **Workflows** section in your OpenOps instance, and click **New Workflow** in the top right corner. What you'll see is the workflow editor, which initially looks like this:

![Empty workflow editor](/images/workflow-editor-empty.png)

Let's look around and see what controls the editor provides:
* In the top left corner, if you click the arrow next to the workflow name, *Untitled*, you get access to a menu that lets you **rename** the new workflow, **delete** it, or **move it to a folder** for better organization:
![Workflow editor controls](/images/workflow-editor-controls.png)
* The icon to the left of the workflow folder and name is a switch that lets you **show or hide the sidebar**, which contains the main OpenOps navigation menu.
* To the right of the workflow name, you have several buttons: **Tree view**, **Version history**, **Run logs**, and **Notes**. Version history and run logs will be more relevant when you [update](/workflow-management/customizing-workflows) or [troubleshoot](/workflow-management/investigate-workflow-run) your workflows later on. For now, you can use **Notes** to describe the intent of your workflow in detail or leave any other comments for future reference. You can also click **Tree view** to display an aside showing the compact structure of your workflow, including its trigger, all actions, as well as [conditions and branches](/workflow-management/conditional-branching):
![Tree view of a workflow](/images/workflow-editor-tree-view.png)

## Adding a trigger

When you create a new workflow, the editor creates an empty stub trigger. Click the trigger node to select a trigger group that works for you:
![Selecting a trigger group](/images/workflow-editor-select-trigger-group.png)

After selecting a group, choose a specific trigger within that group:
![Selecting a trigger](/images/workflow-editor-select-trigger.png)

OpenOps provides over 10 triggers divided into several groups:
* **Schedule**: *Every X minutes*, *Every hour*, *Every day*, *Every week*, *Every month*, *Cron expression*.
* **SFTP**: *New file*.
* **Webhook**: *Catch webhook*.
* **Slack**: *New message*, *New reaction*.
* **Jira Cloud**: *New issue*, *Updated issue*.
* **Monday.com**: *New item in board*, *Specific column value updated in board*.

Some triggers are used more often than others. For most of your scenarios, you will probably use one of the triggers in the **Schedule** group, setting your workflows to run at a predetermined interval.

After selecting a trigger, click the trigger node again to display a right-hand pane with the properties of the trigger. For example, here are the properties of the *Every day* trigger:
![Trigger properties](/images/workflow-editor-trigger-properties.png)

You can choose a specific hour in a specific time zone and include weekends, or go with the reasonable defaults.

Properties will vary with each type of trigger. For example, if the trigger is a new issue in Jira Cloud, you can specify a search query using Jira's JQL query language.

## Adding an action

As soon as you've created a trigger, the next and all subsequent steps of your workflow will be actions. Click the **+** icon under the trigger, and a pop-up menu will display a list of available action categories. Clicking a category lets you select a specific action:
![Selecting an action](/images/workflow-editor-select-action.png)

OpenOps provides a total of [120+ actions](/workflow-management/actions/). One way to make sense of them is to classify them by intent:
* To **get data** for your workflow to process, look at cloud provider integration actions like **AWS** or **Azure**, recommendation provider actions such as **Anodot** and **AWS Compute Optimizer**, or generic **HTTP** actions.
* To **control the execution of your workflow**, use actions grouped under **Condition** and **Split**, **Loop on items**, **Delay**, and **End Workflow**.
* To **process data obtained in previous steps**, use **Date, List, Math, and Text operations**, **Data mapper** for advanced transformations, and **Code** for transformations that you can't express with available no-code actions.
* To **request human intervention**, use **Approval** or **Slack**.
* To **make or request changes to cloud resources**, use cloud provider actions, IaC integration actions like **AWS CloudFormation** and **Terraform**, and the **GitHub** action.
* To **make updates in project management tools**, use **Jira Cloud** or **Monday.com** actions.
* To **save data and generate reports**, use **SMTP**, **SFTP**, **Storage**, and **OpenOps Tables** actions.

When you select an action, OpenOps adds it to the workflow graph and displays a right-hand pane with the properties of the action:
![Properties of an action](/images/workflow-editor-action-properties.png)

The specific set of properties depends on the type of action. Here are a few general rules:
* Actions that get data from or send data to external resources will require you to define a **connection**. For example, for AWS-related actions, you'd need to specify your access key ID, secret access key, and the default region. For a Slack connection, you'd specify your Slack instance's redirect URL, your client ID, and your client secret. One connection can be reused across multiple actions, and the OpenOps UI provides a separate view to list all connections you have defined so far.
* Actions that process data obtained in previous steps will ask you to specify the input data. For details on passing data between actions, see [Input and Output Parameters](/workflow-management/input-output-parameters).
* Every action has two toggles: **Continue on Failure**, which lets the current action fail and continues the workflow regardless, and **Retry on Failure**, which retries the current action up to four times before giving up.

## Testing a workflow

Underneath the properties pane, every action has a **Generate Sample Data** section, which lets you test or retest the action in isolation and shows the output that it generates:
![Sample data generated for an Anodot integration action](/images/workflow-editor-action-generate-sample-data.png)

As soon as you have implemented all steps, including a trigger and actions, you may also want to test your entire workflow. To do this, click the **Test Workflow** button at the top of the workflow editor, right above the trigger node:
![Testing the entire workflow](/images/workflow-editor-test-workflow.png)

After performing a test run of the workflow, OpenOps will show results of the run in the **Run Details** pane to the left of the editor, indicating the status of each step, as well as its inputs and outputs:
![Run details after testing the entire workflow](/images/workflow-editor-run-details.png)

## Publishing a workflow

When you're happy with your workflow and want to start running it, click **Publish** in the top right corner.

This also applies when you're editing an existing workflow: to avoid disrupting pending workflow runs, your changes won't take effect until you publish them.
