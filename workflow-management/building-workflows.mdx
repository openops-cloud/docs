title: 'Building Workflows From Scratch'
description: 'TODO'
---

In many cases, you can apply optimizations by taking one of the pre-made [workflow templates](workflow-templates), creating a workflow off of the template, and [customizing it](customizing-workflows) to your liking.

When there's no template to bootstrap from, you can create a new workflow from scratch.

To do this, go to the **Flows** section in your OpenOps instance, and click **New Flow** in the upper right corner. What's you'll see is the workflow editor that initially looks like this:

In order to create a minimal usable workflow, you need to:
1. Add a trigger.
2. Add at least one action.
3. Publish the workflow.

Triggers and actions are the two basic building blocks of every workflow:
* A **trigger** is your workflow's starting point. It defines how often your workflow executes. It may also represent an event that needs to occur for your workflow to kick off. A workflow always has exactly one trigger.
* **Actions** define the steps of your workflow that start executing once your workflow is activated by a trigger.

Below is an example of a workflow that is triggered on a schedule. The first node represents the schedule trigger, and all other nodes are actions:

In a different example, here's a workflow that uses an update of a JIRA issue as a trigger:
