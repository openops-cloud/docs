To mitigate concerns around full automation - such as large-scale deletions - OpenOps integrates Human-in-the-Loop mechanisms. This ensures that critical operations always involve human oversight.

For example, you can create a workflow that flags idle RDS instances for review, prompting human approval before any scaling down or termination actions are taken, giving you both control and efficiency.
