When you create a new workflow or start editing an existing one, you're working with a draft. For draft editing, there are **Undo** and **Redo** buttons in the top menu of the workflow editor:
![Undo/Redo](/images/versioning-undo-redo.png)

Use **Undo** and **Redo** to cancel or repeat the creation of workflow steps. Note that operations more granular than step creation, such as modifying the properties of an action, do not create a new item in the undo stack.

Every time you publish a workflow, OpenOps records the published version so you can view or restore it later. When a workflow is open in the workflow editor, you can click **Version History** in the drop-down menu:
![Version History Menu Item](/images/versioning-menu-version-history.png)

This opens the **Version History** pane to the left of the editor:

The version that is currently published is marked with a green dot.

The eye icon marks the version that you're currently viewing. If you click the three-dot menu to the right of a version, you can choose to view that version or use it as a starting point to draft a new version:

Reverting to an earlier version is especially useful if the latest published version of a workflow has proven to be problematic, and you'd like to revert to an older version that works. In this case, select **Use as draft** for a previous version known to be functional, then click **Publish**, and the working version is now back in action.

Note that whenever you start editing your workflow, your current draft is also represented in **Version History** by a record with a yellow dot next to it:
