Sometimes you may want to share a workflow you've created with others or import one that someone else has created. Here's how you can do this in OpenOps.

## Exporting workflows

To export a workflow:
1. Open the workflow you want to export in the workflow editor.
2. Click the arrow next to the workflow name in the top left of the editor.
3. Click **Export**:
   ![Workflow editor controls](/images/workflow-editor-controls.png)
4. Save the workflow as a JSON file to your computer.

A workflow export file contains all actions and properties of the original workflow. It does not include the connection settings used in your OpenOps installation. When importing into a different OpenOps installation, the recipient will need to configure their own connections.

## Importing workflows

To import a workflow:
1. Click **New Workflow** to create a new empty workflow in your OpenOps installation.
2. In the top left of the workflow editor, click the arrow next to the workflow name.
3. Click **Import**:
   ![Workflow editor controls](/images/workflow-editor-controls.png)
4. In the **Import Workflow** dialog, click **Choose file**.
5. Select the downloaded JSON file.
6. Click **Import**.
7. If the imported workflow requires connections that your OpenOps instance doesn't have, you'll be prompted to create them.
8. Once you've finished creating connections, click **Create workflow**.
