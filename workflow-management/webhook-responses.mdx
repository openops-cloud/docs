When a workflow is triggered by a webhook, you can send a custom HTTP response back to the caller. This enables synchronous communication patterns where the webhook caller waits for and receives a response from your workflow.

## Use cases

Webhook responses are useful when you need to:

- Return processed data to the webhook caller
- Acknowledge receipt of webhook data with custom status codes
- Implement synchronous API endpoints using OpenOps workflows
- Provide immediate feedback to external systems

## How it works

When a workflow is triggered by a webhook, OpenOps can send a response back to the caller before the workflow completes. The response includes:

- HTTP status code
- Response headers
- Response body (JSON or raw text)

By default, webhook triggers return a standard acknowledgment response. Use the **Send Webhook Response** action to customize this response.

## Sending a webhook response

To send a custom response to a webhook caller:

1. Add the **HTTP** block's **Send Webhook Response** action to your workflow
2. Configure the response properties:
   - **Status**: HTTP status code (default: 200)
   - **Headers**: Custom HTTP headers as a JSON object
   - **Body Type**: Choose between JSON or Raw text
   - **Response**: The response body content

### Example: JSON response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Data processed successfully",
    "processedAt": "2026-01-29T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Example: Raw text response

```text
Status: 200
Body Type: Raw
Response: "Operation completed successfully"
```

## Response timing

The webhook response is sent as soon as the **Send Webhook Response** action executes in your workflow. The workflow continues to run after sending the response, but the webhook caller receives the response immediately.

<Note>
If your workflow doesn't include a **Send Webhook Response** action, OpenOps automatically sends a default acknowledgment at the end of the workflow execution.

### Default response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "message": "Request completed."
  }
}
```
</Note>

## Best practices

- **Send responses early**: Place the **Send Webhook Response** action early in your workflow to avoid timeouts
- **Use appropriate status codes**: Return meaningful HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400 for bad requests, 500 for errors)
- **Include error handling**: Use conditional branching to send different responses based on workflow outcomes
- **Keep responses lightweight**: Avoid sending large payloads in webhook responses

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook callers time out when waiting for a synchronous response

If the webhook caller waits for a response from the workflow and the request times out at the reverse proxy, increase the Nginx timeouts for the webhook sync endpoint.

1. Set the `NGINX_WEBHOOK_SYNC_TIMEOUT` environment variable.
2. Deploy/restart the Nginx container so it picks up the new value.

OpenOps applies `NGINX_WEBHOOK_SYNC_TIMEOUT` to the Nginx timeouts for requests that match the `/api/v1/webhooks/<id>/sync` path.

## Limitations

- Only one response can be sent per webhook trigger
- The response is sent asynchronously through the OpenOps engine

## Example workflow

Here's a complete example of a workflow that receives webhook data, processes it, and sends a custom response:

1. **Webhook trigger**: Catches incoming webhook
2. **Data validation**: Validates the incoming data
3. **Send Webhook Response**: Sends acknowledgment to caller
4. **Process data**: Continues processing in the background
5. **Store results**: Saves processed data to a database

This pattern allows you to acknowledge receipt immediately while continuing to process data asynchronously.
