Action execution limits are enforced to prevent excessive or unintended usage of workflow steps in OpenOps. When a workflow step exceeds its allowed number of executions, OpenOps will immediately stop further processing, and the affected step will be marked with the `EXECUTION_LIMIT_REACHED` status.

## Purpose
This page explains how execution limits work in OpenOps workflows and how to interpret the `EXECUTION_LIMIT_REACHED` status, with guidance on handling workflows that reach these constraints.

## How Execution Limits Work
- Each action within a workflow may have a pre-defined execution limit set by the platform or configured per workflow.
- If a workflow step exceeds its allowed execution attempts (for example, due to retries, looping, or repeated triggers), OpenOps halts workflow progression at that step.
- The workflow step status will become `EXECUTION_LIMIT_REACHED`.
- No further actions will execute in that workflow run after the limit is reached.

## Step Status: `EXECUTION_LIMIT_REACHED`
When you observe the `EXECUTION_LIMIT_REACHED` status on a workflow step:
- The step attempted to run more times than allowed.
- The workflow was halted at this point; no downstream actions were processed.
- This status is visible in workflow run details and logs.

## Example
Suppose you have an action set to execute a maximum of 3 times. If logic in your workflow causes this action to run a 4th time, execution will stop, and the affected step will show:

```json
{
  "status": "EXECUTION_LIMIT_REACHED",
  "action": "scale-down-resources",
  "attempts": 4,
  "limit": 3
}
```

## What to Do When a Limit is Reached
- Review the workflow logic for excessive retries or loops.
- Adjust the action's configuration or execution limit if appropriate.
- Rerun the workflow only after addressing the root cause.
- If you require higher execution thresholds, contact your OpenOps administrator to request a policy update.

## Troubleshooting
- Check the workflow execution logs for detailed step counts.
- Inspect conditions, loops, and retries that may contribute to rapid step execution.
- Ensure that limit values align with organizational policies.
