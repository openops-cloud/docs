title: 'Passing Data Between Workflow Steps'
description: 'Using data from previous steps in the current one'

## General principles

Any OpenOps workflow consists of multiple steps. The first step is a **trigger**, followed by any number of **action** steps. Not all steps produce data, but many do.

Any step can access data that is the output of all of its previous steps.

For example, in the section of a workflow shown above:
* **Step 5** has access to data produced by steps 4, 3, and 2. The only reason it doesn't have access to data from step 1 is that this Schedule trigger step doesn't produce any data.
* **Step 4** has access to data produced by step 3 and 2.
* **Step 3** has access to data produced by step 2.
