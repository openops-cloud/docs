## Overview

OpenOps includes a benchmark flow that is represented in the API as a multi-step wizard.

At the API level, the wizard request can include:

* `currentStep` (optional)
* `benchmarkConfiguration` (optional)

Wizard steps returned by the API include:

* `currentStep`
* `title`
* `description` (optional)
* `nextStep` (string or `null`)
* `selectionType` (`single` or `multi-select`)
* `options` (each option includes `id`, `displayName`, and optional `imageLogoUrl` and `metadata`)
* `stepIndex`
* `totalSteps`

When a benchmark run is initiated, the API returns an `orchestratorRunId`.
