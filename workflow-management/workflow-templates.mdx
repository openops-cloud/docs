OpenOps provides a pre-made library of FinOps best-practice workflows, based on research and input from FinOps leaders across industries and verticals.

The library, referred to as the **Templates catalog**, contains dozens of templates that provide ready-to-use recipes for anomaly management, workload and rate optimization across the following cloud services:
* Amazon EC2, CloudWatch, EBS, CloudFront, RDS, and S3
* Azure VM

## Exploring templates

To view the catalog, click **Explore templates** in the top-right menu bar in the **Overview** or **Workflows** section:
![Explore Templates](/images/explore-templates.png)

The catalog will open in an overlay:

By default, the catalog contains six templates. To view more, click **Explore more** and sign up for a free OpenOps Cloud account. As a result, the **Templates catalog** in your OpenOps installation will be extended to show all available templates:

## Creating workflows based on templates

When you click a template in the catalog, OpenOps displays its full description, a preview diagram visualizing the workflow steps defined in the template, and the integrations that the template uses:

If you want to use the workflow defined in the template, click **Use template** in the top-right corner.

OpenOps will then ask you to specify existing or create new connections to cloud services that are required for the selected template to work:

You can set up the required connections now or later. When you click **Create workflow**, your workflow will open in the workflow editor, where you can [customize it to your liking](building-workflows).
