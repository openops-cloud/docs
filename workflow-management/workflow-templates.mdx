OpenOps provides a pre-made library of FinOps best-practice workflows, based on research and input from hundreds of FinOps leaders across industries and verticals.

The library currently contains around 30 templates that provide ready-to-use recipes for anomaly management, workload and rate optimization across the following cloud services:
* Amazon EC2, CloudWatch, EBS, CloudFront, RDS, and S3
* Azure VM

> TODO how to enable the template catalog in a new installation? Signing up to the cloud

As soon as the template catalog is added to your OpenOps instance, you can access it by going to the **Flows** section and clicking **Explore templates** in the top right menu bar.

When you click a template in the catalog, OpenOps shows its full description, a preview diagram that visualizes the flow step defined in the template, as well as integrations that the template uses:

If you want to use the workflow that the template defines, click **Use template** in the top right corner.

OpenOps will then ask you to specify existing or create new connections to cloud services that are required for the selected template to work:

After specifying the required connections, click **Create workflow**.

The workflow will then open in the workflow editor where you can [customize it to your liking](customizing-workflows).
