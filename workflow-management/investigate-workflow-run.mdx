If a workflow didn't execute the way you expected it to, you can investigate what went wrong by viewing the history of workflow runs. You can do this [from the **Runs** view](#finding-a-run-from-the-runs-view) or directly [from the workflow editor](#finding-a-run-from-the-workflow-editor).

## Finding a run from the Runs view

Click **Runs** in the OpenOps main menu.

This opens the list of all runs across all your workflows, with the most recent runs shown first:

You can filter the list by workflow name, run status, or a date range:

When you've found a run you want to investigate, click on it. This will open the workflow editor in a view-only mode.

## Finding a run from the workflow editor

If the workflow you want to investigate is already open in the workflow editor, click **Run logs** in the top menu:

In the **Recent Runs** pane that opens on the left, click a run that you want to investigate. Failed runs are marked with the ❌ icon:

This will open the selected run in the **Run Details** pane.

## Investigating in the Run Details view

In the **Run Details** pane, each workflow step will display a ✅ or a ❌ to indicate its execution status.

Click on a failed step to see its inputs and outputs. Explore the outputs to view the error message:

To update the workflow to address the error, click **Edit** in the top-right corner of the workflow editor. This switches the editor from view-only mode, enabling you to select the problematic step and modify its properties.
