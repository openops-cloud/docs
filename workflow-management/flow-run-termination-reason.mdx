OpenOps provides detailed termination and error context for every workflow execution using the `terminationReason` field. This guide explains where and how to use this field in flow run APIs and error handling logic.

## Purpose
The `terminationReason` field allows users and integrators to understand why a workflow execution ended, whether completed successfully, failed with an error, or was terminated for another reason.

## Where to Find `terminationReason`

- **Flow (Workflow) Execution Context:**
  - Present in backend models representing the status of a run
- **API Responses:**
  - Returned in results when querying a single run or list of runs, e.g. `/api/v1/flow-runs/:id`, `/api/v1/flow-runs`
- **Service and Executor Layers:**
  - Used for logging and tracking run outcomes programmatically

### Example API Response

```json
{
  "id": "run-12345",
  "status": "failed",
  "terminationReason": "step_error:timeout_on_resource_scan",
  "startedAt": "2025-10-15T07:24:00Z",
  "endedAt": "2025-10-15T07:24:40Z"
}
```

## Possible Values
- `null` or empty when the run has not terminated
- Short string describing the termination reason (e.g., `completed`, `cancelled_by_user`, `step_error:timeout_on_resource_scan`, `dependency_failure`, etc.)

## Usage
- **Diagnostics and Troubleshooting:** Use the `terminationReason` field when investigating run failures or unexpected behavior
- **Automation:** Filter or branch flows based on `terminationReason` in scripts or programmatic integrations

## Best Practices
- Display or log `terminationReason` alongside status in custom dashboards or notification systems
- Refer to it directly when responding to support incidents or analyzing workflow health

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If `terminationReason` indicates a system or step error, refer to [Investigate Workflow Run](/workflow-management/investigate-workflow-run) for step-by-step debugging guidance
- Cross-reference the reason string with workflow definition and step configuration for root cause analysis
