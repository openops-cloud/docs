OpenOps provides 120+ actions: operations that you can add as steps to your workflows.

When you select an action in the workflow editor, actions are presented as groups. By default, you see the list of all action groups:

You can also filter them to only show **core** actions, or actions related to various integrations, which are referred to as **apps**:

Below is an overview of groups of actions that are currently available in OpenOps. To help you make better sense of them, they're grouped by intent in the following sections. Some groups of actions may be listed in multiple sections if they contain actions with different intent.

## Decide

These are the actions that help you control the sequence of operations in your workflow and make decisions based on inputs:

* **Condition**: split the workflow into exactly two branches based on a [condition](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/).
* **Split**: split the workflow into multiple branches based on a [condition](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/).
* **Loop on items**: iterate over a list of items obtained in a prior step. For better performance, OpenOps enables parallel execution of loop iterations whenever possible.
* **Delay**: halt execution of the workflow for a given time period or until a specific time.
* **End Workflow**: stop executing the workflow. This is useful with [conditional branching](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/) and one of your branches is for a condition that ends the workflow early. When used inside a loop, this action skips to the next iteration of the loop.

## Get data

These actions help you receive data from your cloud resources, third-party services, APIs, and other sources.

* Cloud provider integrations:
    * **AWS**: includes multiple actions around AWS resources such as EC2, EBS, and RDS.
    * **Azure**: execute Azure CLI commands.
* Recommendation service integrations:
    * **Anodot**: get recommendations from [Anadot](https://www.anodot.com/), manage comments and user status.
    * **AWS Compute Optimizer**: get a summary of recommendations, EBS- or EC2-specific recommendations.
* **AWS Athena**: send queries to Athena databases.
* **File operations**: create or read files in OpenOps storage.
* **HTTP**: send an HTTP request to any API or send an HTTP response.

## Process data

These actions enable you to apply various transformations to data received on prior workflow steps.

* **List operations**: process a list (array) that is an output of another workflow step by grouping, mapping, or extracting values.
* **Date operations**: format dates, extract individual date units (year, month, day, hour, etc.), or calculate date differences.
* **Math operations**: apply arithmetic operations, average numbers, get minimum and maximum values, generate random numbers.
* **Text operations**: concatenate, split, find and replace text; convert from HTML to Markdown and vice versa.
* **Code**: write custom code in TypeScript or JavaScript.

## Request human intervention

These actions implement [Human-in-the-Loop](/workflow-management/human-in-the-loop/) processes: requesting approvals and sending notifications.

* **Approval**: request approval with or without pausing the workflow.
* **Slack**: send and update messages, request and wait for user actions.

## Make changes to cloud resources

These are integration actions that combine various ways to make and request changes to your cloud resources via cloud provider APIs, IaC tools, or pull requests.

* Cloud provider integrations:
    * **AWS**: multiple actions around AWS resources such as EC2, EBS, and RDS.
    * **Azure**: execute Azure CLI commands.
* IaC integrations:
    * **AWS CloudFormation**: manage templates and resources.
    * **Terraform**: update or delete resources.
* Other integrations:
    * **GitHub**: get file content, create pull requests, or trigger GitHub Actions runs.

## Interact with project management tools

These actions help get and update data from/to boards and issues in project management tools:

* **Jira Cloud**: search, create, or update issues and issue comments.
* **Monday.com**: manage boards, groups, columns, and items.

## Save data and report

These actions help save and send information obtained during workflow runs.

* **OpenOps Tables**: create and update records in [tables](/reporting-analytics/tables/).
* **SFTP**: create or read files on a remote server via SFTP.
* **Storage**: manage data in your OpenOps installation's own storage.
* **SMTP**: send emails.
