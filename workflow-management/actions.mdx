OpenOps provides 120+ actions: operations that you can add as steps to your workflows.

When you select an action in the workflow editor, actions are grouped into blocks. By default, you see a list of all available blocks:
<NarrowImage src="/images/workflow-editor-select-action.png" alt="Selecting an action" />

You can also filter them to show actions that belong to a specific category, such as *Collaboration*, *Data Sources*, or *FinOps*:
<NarrowImage src="/images/workflow-editor-actions-filter.png" alt="Action filters" />

Below is an overview of the action blocks currently available in OpenOps. To help you navigate them more easily, they are categorized by intent in the following sections. Some action blocks appear in multiple sections if they contain actions with different intents.

## Decide

These actions help control the sequence of operations in your workflow and make decisions based on inputs:

* **Condition**: split the workflow into exactly two branches based on a [condition](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/).
* **Split**: split the workflow into multiple branches based on a [condition](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/).
* **Loop on Items**: iterates sequentially over a list. Each iteration runs independently and may finish, fail, or pause, but the loop continues with the next item. After all iterations, the loop's final state reflects the outcomes: if any iterations fail, the loop fails; if any pause, the loop pauses until they resume. Workflow-wide limits ([timeouts](/workflow-management/investigate-workflow-run#changing-the-default-timeout) or size limits) can also halt execution.
* **Delay**: pause workflow execution for a specified time period or until a specific time.
* **Stop Execution**: stops the execution of the current scope. When used inside a loop, this action skips to the next iteration; otherwise, it ends the entire workflow. This is useful in [conditional branching](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/) when a branch represents a condition that ends the workflow early.

## Get data

These actions help you retrieve data from cloud resources, third-party services, APIs, and other sources.

* Cloud provider integrations:
    * **AWS**: includes multiple actions related to AWS resources such as EC2, EBS, and RDS, as well as a CLI action to execute commands that are not available as dedicated actions.
    * **Azure**: execute Azure CLI commands, make REST API calls, query Azure Resource Graph using KQL.
    * **Google Cloud**: execute Google Cloud CLI commands, make REST API calls, run SQL queries on BigQuery.
* Recommendation and analytics service integrations:
    * **[Archera](https://archera.ai/)**: retrieve available and recommended commitment plans for cloud providers.
    * **AWS Compute Optimizer**: retrieve a summary of recommendations, as well as EBS- or EC2-specific recommendations.
    * **Azure**: get Azure Advisor cost recommendations.
    * **[CloudFix](https://cloudfix.com/)**: get recommendations and reports, or create change requests.
    * **[CloudHealth](https://www.vmware.com/products/app-platform/tanzu-cloudhealth)**: get recommendations, search assets and retrieve asset perspectives, or manage asset tags.

    * **[Ternary](https://ternary.app/)**: fetch usage recommendations, retrieve budgets and anomalies, get and create cases and users.
    * **[Umbrella](https://umbrellacost.com/)** (formerly Anodot): get recommendations, manage comments, get user accounts, update user status.
    * **[Vantage](https://www.vantage.sh/)**: perform custom API calls.
    * **[Vega Cloud](https://www.vegacloud.io/)**: get anomalies, perform API calls to fetch recommendations or forecasts.
* **AWS Athena**: run Athena queries.
* **Snowflake**: run individual or batch Snowflake queries.
* **Databricks**: run SQL queries in Databricks workspaces and trigger existing jobs.
* **File operations**: create or read files in OpenOps storage.
* **HTTP**: send HTTP requests to any API or respond to HTTP requests.

Many actions in this category involve writing CLI commands (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Google Cloud CLI) or SQL queries (AWS Athena, Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery). The OpenOps workflow editor provides [AI assistance](/ai-assistance/overview/) to generate such commands and queries, making it less overwhelming for occasional and less technical users. AI assistance works [using your own API keys](/ai-assistance/llm-connections/) with an LLM provider of your choice. OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and a dozen other LLM providers are supported.

## Process data

These actions allow you to apply various transformations to data received from previous workflow steps.

* **List operations**: process a list (array) output from another workflow step by grouping, mapping, or extracting values.
* **Date operations**: format dates, extract individual date units (year, month, day, hour, etc.), or calculate date differences.
* **Math operations**: perform arithmetic operations, average numbers, find minimum and maximum values, or generate random numbers.
* **Text operations**: concatenate, split, find and replace text, and convert between HTML and Markdown.
* **AI Step**: enter LLM prompts with inputs from previous steps, and receive responses in structured or unstructured formats.
* **Code**: execute custom code in TypeScript or JavaScript. [AI assistance](/ai-assistance/overview/) is available to help you generate and insert code for actions of this kind.

## Request human intervention

These actions implement [Human-in-the-Loop](/workflow-management/human-in-the-loop/) processes: requesting approvals and sending notifications.

* **Approval**: request approval with or without pausing the workflow.
* **Slack**: send and update messages, request human action, and wait for user responses.
* **SMTP**: send emails through a custom SMTP server.
* **Jira Cloud**: update issues and issue status, create and update issue comments.
* **Microsoft Teams**: send chat and channel messages.
* **Monday.com**: create and update boards and board items.
* **Linear**: create and update issues and comments.
* **Zendesk**: create or update tickets, perform other Zendesk API calls.

## Make changes to cloud resources

These are integration actions that provide various ways to make and request changes to your cloud resources via cloud provider APIs, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools, or pull requests.

* Cloud provider integrations:
    * **AWS**: multiple actions related to AWS resources such as EC2, EBS, and RDS, an action to prefill AWS Systems Manager runbooks and generate execution links, as well as an AWS CLI action to execute any command.
    * **Azure**: execute Azure CLI commands and make REST API calls.
    * **Google Cloud**: execute Google Cloud CLI commands and make REST API calls.
* IaC integrations:
    * **AWS CloudFormation**: update or delete resources in a CloudFormation template.
    * **Terraform**: update or delete resources in a Terraform template, modify Terraform variables files.
* Other integrations:
    * **Snowflake**: add rows to Snowflake tables.
    * **GitHub**: retrieve file content, create pull requests, or trigger GitHub Actions runs.
    * **Archera**: apply commitment plans for cloud providers.

Since many of these actions can make destructive changes in your cloud environment, they are considered high-risk and are marked with a red shield icon in the [workflow editor](/workflow-management/building-workflows/):
<NarrowImage src="/images/actions-high-risk.png" alt="An action with a high-risk warning icon" widthPercent={50} />

## Interact with project management tools

These actions allow you to retrieve and update data in issues and boards in project management tools.

* **Jira Cloud**: search, create, or update issues and issue comments.
* **Monday.com**: manage boards, groups, columns, and items.
* **Linear**: create and update projects, issues, and comments.
* **ServiceNow**: retrieve, add, update, or delete records and requests.
* **Zendesk**: make API calls to Zendesk to create or update tickets, create chat messages, and more.

## Save data and report

These actions help store and share information collected during workflow runs.

* **OpenOps Tables**: create and update records in [tables](/reporting-analytics/tables/).
* **Microsoft Outlook**: send, forward, reply to, find, and move emails.
* **SFTP**: create or read files on a remote server via SFTP.
* **SMTP**: send emails.
* **Storage**: store data in and read it from your OpenOps installation's key-value storage. The storage is accessible at the run, workflow, and installation levels.
    * **Put**: saves or overwrites a string value under a given key.
    * **Get**: retrieves a string value by key from storage. If the key does not exist, returns an optional default value.
    * **Append**: appends text to an existing string value. Optionally inserts a separator between values (for example, `\n` for new lines). Fails if the existing value is an array, not a string — in this case, use *Add To List* instead.
    * **Remove**: deletes a key and its associated value from storage.
    * **Add To List**: treats the stored value as an array and appends a new item to it. The item value is always stored as text: any non-string input is implicitly converted to a string (for example, objects are JSON-serialized). If the key does not exist, it is created and initialized with an empty array. Can optionally skip insertion if an equal value already exists in the array. Fails if the existing value is a string, not an array — in this case, use *Append* instead.
    * **Remove from List**: removes a matching item from an array value for the given key. Uses deep equality to find the item. If multiple matching values exist, only the first match is removed. Fails if the stored value is not an array.
    * **List**: returns all keys and their values (both strings and arrays) in storage for the selected scope. Supports optional regex-based key filtering.
