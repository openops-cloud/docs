OpenOps provides 120+ actions: steps that you can combine in your workflows.

When you select an action in the workflow editor, actions are presented as groups. By default, you see the list of all action groups:

You can also filter them to only show **core** actions, or actions related to various integrations, which are referred to as **apps**:
