OpenOps provides 120+ actions: operations that you can add as steps to your workflows.

When you select an action in the workflow editor, actions are presented as groups. By default, you see a list of all action groups:

You can also filter them to show only **core** actions or actions related to various integrations, referred to as **apps**:

Below is an overview of the action groups currently available in OpenOps. To help you navigate them more easily, they are categorized by intent in the following sections. Some action groups appear in multiple sections if they contain actions with different intents.

## Decide

These actions help control the sequence of operations in your workflow and make decisions based on inputs:

* **Condition**: split the workflow into exactly two branches based on a [condition](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/).
* **Split**: split the workflow into multiple branches based on a [condition](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/).
* **Loop on Items**: iterate over a list of items obtained in a prior step. For better performance, OpenOps enables parallel execution of loop iterations whenever possible.
* **Delay**: pause workflow execution for a specified time period or until a specific time.
* **End Workflow**: stop workflow execution. This is useful in [conditional branching](/workflow-management/conditional-branching/) when a branch represents a condition that ends the workflow early. When used inside a loop, this action skips to the next iteration of the loop.

## Get data

These actions help you retrieve data from cloud resources, third-party services, APIs, and other sources.

* Cloud provider integrations:
    * **AWS**: includes multiple actions related to AWS resources such as EC2, EBS, and RDS, as well as a CLI action to execute commands that are not available as dedicated actions.
    * **Azure**: execute Azure CLI commands.
* Recommendation service integrations:
    * **Anodot**: get recommendations from [Anodot](https://www.anodot.com/), manage comments, and update user status.
    * **AWS Compute Optimizer**: retrieve a summary of recommendations, as well as EBS- or EC2-specific recommendations.
* **AWS Athena**: run Athena queries.
* **File operations**: create or read files in OpenOps storage.
* **HTTP**: send HTTP requests to any API or respond to HTTP requests.

## Process data

These actions allow you to apply various transformations to data received from previous workflow steps.

* **List operations**: process a list (array) output from another workflow step by grouping, mapping, or extracting values.
* **Date operations**: format dates, extract individual date units (year, month, day, hour, etc.), or calculate date differences.
* **Math operations**: perform arithmetic operations, average numbers, find minimum and maximum values, or generate random numbers.
* **Text operations**: concatenate, split, find and replace text, and convert between HTML and Markdown.
* **Code**: execute custom code in TypeScript or JavaScript.

## Request human intervention

These actions implement [Human-in-the-Loop](/workflow-management/human-in-the-loop/) processes: requesting approvals and sending notifications.

* **Approval**: request approval with or without pausing the workflow.
* **Slack**: send and update messages, request human action, and wait for user responses.
* **SMTP**: send emails through a custom SMTP server.
* **Jira Cloud**: update issues and issue status, create and update issue comments.
* **Microsoft Teams**: send chat and channel messages.
* **monday.com**: create and update boards and board items.

## Make changes to cloud resources

These are integration actions that provide various ways to make and request changes to your cloud resources via cloud provider APIs, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools, or pull requests.

* Cloud provider integrations:
    * **AWS**: multiple actions related to AWS resources such as EC2, EBS, and RDS, as well as an AWS CLI action to execute any command.
    * **Azure**: execute Azure CLI commands.
* IaC integrations:
    * **AWS CloudFormation**: update or delete resources in a CloudFormation template.
    * **Terraform**: update or delete resources in a Terraform template.
* Other integrations:
    * **GitHub**: retrieve file content, create pull requests, or trigger GitHub Actions runs.

## Interact with project management tools

These actions allow you to retrieve and update data in issues and boards in project management tools.

* **Jira Cloud**: search, create, or update issues and issue comments.
* **Monday.com**: manage boards, groups, columns, and items.

## Save data and report

These actions help store and share information collected during workflow runs.

* **OpenOps Tables**: create and update records in [tables](/reporting-analytics/tables/).
* **SFTP**: create or read files on a remote server via SFTP.
* **Storage**: store data in and read it from your OpenOps installation's key-value storage. The storage is accessible at run, workflow, and project levels.
* **SMTP**: send emails.
