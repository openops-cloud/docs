description: 'How to split your workflow based on conditions'

Depending on data received in previous steps of your workflow, you may want to decide how to proceed further. Two actions will help you split your workflow based on a condition:
* [**Condition**](#condition) splits the workflow into exactly two branches.
* [**Split**](#split) splits the workflow into multiple branches.

You can add either of these just like you add any other action, using the **+** button in the workflow editor:

## Condition

The **Condition** action splits the workflow into exactly two branches. One is executed if one or multiple conditions that you specify are satisfied, and the other is executed otherwise.

Think of this as an equivalent of an `if` statement in programming.

If you choose the **Condition** action, the properties pane on the right will let you define the condition. By default, there's only one condition, but you combine multiple conditions with logical conjunction (click **And**) or disjunction (click **Or**).

Every condition contains one or two data fields. Clicking a data field opens the **Data Selector** view that lets you select output from any of your prior actions:

Alongside the data fields, there's a combo box that defines the specific operation for your condition. See [Operators](#operators) for details.

Here's an example of a complete condition that takes a list from a previous action and checks if the list contains any actions &mdash; in other words, if its length is more than zero:

As you can see in the screenshot above, you can test your condition in the **Generate Sample Data** pane and see if the result is what you expected.

## Split

The **Split** action splits the workflow into multiple branches. Each branch executes if its specific condition is met. An extra branch called the default branch executes if none of the conditions specified for other branches is satisfied.

Think of this action as an equivalent of a `switch` statement in programming.

## Operators

When you define conditions using the **Condition** or **Split** actions, you need to define what operation to apply to the value(s) that you supply. The combo box alongside the data fields lets you do just that:

## To process

> Conditional logic and branching based on data or events

**End Workflow**: stop executing the workflow. If a workflow doesn't branch, this action doesn't have much value. However, it's useful if one or more of your branches represent conditions that should end your workflow early.

If you're dealing with a large workflow, the **Tree view** is a great way to see its compact representation including conditions and branches.
