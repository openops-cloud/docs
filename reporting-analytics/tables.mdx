OpenOps includes [Baserow-based](https://baserow.io/user-docs/intro-to-tables) tables. They are similar to Excel worksheets in that you can sort, filter, aggregate your data and modify many other table features.

OpenOps tables are fully integrated with OpenOps workflow capabilities: there are [actions](/workflow-management/actions/) that let you create and update records in tables, as well as read data from them.

Tables allow you to perform multiple tasks, such as:
* Logging **opportunities and anomalies** in a central location, with options to approve, dismiss, mark as false positive, or snooze.
* Mapping **cloud resources to owners** based on tags and business units. This is an essential stage for workflows that provide human-in-the-loop mechanics. For every resource that provides cost-saving opportunities requiring human intervention, the workflow needs to have a way to know who to send an approval request to.
* Compiling a list of potential **resources to delete**.
* Importing and processing **billing data**.
* Generating **spend reports** broken down by business unit, owner, or cloud service.

## How to use it?

> How to use OpenOps tables
> How to make most of the Opportunity table. Marco: I think we need to talk about how to use the Opportunity table to track realized and unrealized saving amounts and to have visibility on why savings are not yet achieved

## Misc

Anomaly management use case: Log the anomaly and status into one table, with customizable options such as marking as a false positive, acknowledging and snoozing, or acknowledging and taking action.

Use OpenOps tables to log responses and create a continuous feedback loop

Define cost allocation rules. Each company has guidelines on how costs are assigned. Create an OpenOps table to assign resource usage to specific products. Use labels, tags, or metadata to associate costs with specific products, units, or lines of business. Create a centralized source of truth for resource usage, time, and specific services consumption for each product/business unit.
