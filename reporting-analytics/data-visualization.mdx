This guide explains how to configure dashboards in the OpenOps Analytics on top of OpenOps Tables.

## Analytics admin portal

The analytics admin portal is available on the IP address of your installation, under port 3002.
Navigate to http://your-ip:3002

The username is `admin` and the password is in the `.env` file under the installation folder, `OPS_ANALYTICS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (If you havenâ€™t changed the password, the default is `please-change-this-password-1`).

Once you log in, you can see 2 built-in dashboards: **FinOps** and **Homepage**. Modifying the **FinOps** dashboard will affect the **Analytics** tab in OpenOps.

Behind every OpenOps table there is a Postgres view that can be used to build charts and queries.

When a new table is created in [OpenOps tables](/reporting-analytics/tables/), the system automatically creates a new database view with the naming convention _table name \_ table id \_ userfriendly_. This view can be used to create dashboards in the system, and it can also be connected to from other BI systems.

## Building new charts

1. Create a new dataset for the OpenOps table by navigating to **Datasets** and clicking **+ Dataset**. This will allow you to create a dataset on top of the OpenOps tables:

    ![New dataset](/images/analytics-new-dataset.png)
2. After the dataset has been created, you can create new charts by navigating to **Charts** and clicking **+ Chart**.

3. Once you have created the chart, connect it to the **FinOps** dashboard to see it in OpenOps UI:
