You can visualize data that you collect with [OpenOps tables](/reporting-analytics/tables/) and display the visualizations in the **Analytics** view in OpenOps.

## Analytics admin portal

To conigure data visualizations, you need to visit the Analytic admin portal outside of the main OpenOps appllication. The portal is available on the IP address of your OpenOps instance, under port 3002: http://your-ip:3002

To sign in to the Analytics portal, use `admin` as the username and the password defined with the `OPS_ANALYTICS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` variable in the `.env` file in your OpenOps installation folder. (If you havenâ€™t changed the password, the default is `please-change-this-password-1`).

Once you log in, you can see two built-in dashboards: **FinOps** and **Homepage**. Modifying the **FinOps** dashboard will affect the **Analytics** tab in OpenOps.

Behind every OpenOps table there is a Postgres database view that can be used to build charts and queries.

When a new table is created in [OpenOps tables](/reporting-analytics/tables/), the system automatically creates a new database view with the naming convention _table name \_ table id \_ userfriendly_. You can use this view to create dashboards in OpenOps, as well as connect it to other BI systems.

## Building new charts

To configure a new chart to display in the **Analytics** view in OpenOps, do the following:

1. Create a new dataset for the OpenOps table that you want to source data from. To do this, navigate to **Datasets** and click **+ Dataset**. This will allow you to create a dataset on top of one of your OpenOps tables:

2. After the dataset has been created, create a new chart by navigating to **Charts** and clicking **+ Chart**:

3. Configure your chart. Refer to [this Superset documentation page](https://superset.apache.org/docs/using-superset/creating-your-first-dashboard#creating-charts-in-explore-view) if you need help.

4. When saving the chart, add it to the **FinOps** dashboard:

As a result, the chart will display in the **Analytics** view back in OpenOps:
