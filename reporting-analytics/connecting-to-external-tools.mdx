Many organizations use centralized BI/analytics systems and may want to include data generated by OpenOps in their existing dashboards.

OpenOps stores analytics data in a PostgreSQL database. External analytics tools, such as [AWS Quick Sight](#connecting-aws-Quick Sight-to-openops), [Microsoft Power BI](#connecting-microsoft-power-bi-to-openops), or [Google Looker](#connecting-google-looker-to-openops), can connect to this database. Once connected, they can query the same tables and views that power [OpenOps tables](/reporting-analytics/tables), including the *Opportunity* table.

Connecting any external analytics tool to OpenOps consists of two parts.

First, you need to **prepare OpenOps to accept external connections**. At a high level, this usually means:
* Ensuring the PostgreSQL container is reachable from the analytics tool.
* Allowing incoming connections on the PostgreSQL port (`5432`) through your cloud provider’s networking layer (security groups, VPC firewall rules, etc.).
* Optionally configuring a read-only database user for analytics.

Depending on your environment, connectivity may be provided through private VPC networking, VPN, or site-to-site tunnels.

Second, you need to **configure your external analytics tool to connect to PostgreSQL**. This usually involves configuring the OpenOps installation's host and port, database name, authentication method, and selecting the tables or views to visualize.

A specific configuration will vary depending on the analytics tool. See the sections below detailing how to connect to OpenOps from several popular analytics products.

## Connecting AWS Quick Sight to OpenOps

AWS Quick Sight is a fully managed SaaS analytics service. To connect Quick Sight to OpenOps, you must make the OpenOps PostgreSQL database reachable from your AWS account.

Available networking options include:
* **AWS Site-to-Site VPN** to your data center or VPC.
* **AWS Direct Connect**.
* **VPC Peering** if OpenOps runs inside AWS.
* **AWS PrivateLink** if exposing PostgreSQL through a private endpoint.

Once network access is available, you can configure Quick Sight to use the OpenOps PostgreSQL database as a data source.

## Connecting Microsoft Power BI to OpenOps

Power BI has two ways to reach on-premises or private-network databases.

If you're using the self-hosted **Power BI Report Server**, it can connect directly to PostgreSQL inside the same LAN/VPC as OpenOps.

If you're using **Power BI Service** as SaaS, it cannot directly reach internal databases. Instead, you need to use the [Microsoft On-Premises Data Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-onprem), which should be installed on any machine that can access the OpenOps PostgreSQL port. This gateway acts as a secure bridge between Power BI's cloud service and the local PostgreSQL database.

After connectivity is configured, you create a PostgreSQL data source in Power BI (via the gateway or locally) and select the relevant OpenOps tables.

## Connecting Google Looker to OpenOps

Google has two different analytics products:

- **Looker (Looker ML platform)** — available as SaaS or **self-hosted**
- **Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio)** — **SaaS only**

### **Looker (hosted or self-hosted)**

Looker supports both cloud and self-hosted deployments.
If deployed inside the customer’s LAN or VPC, it can connect directly to OpenOps PostgreSQL.
When using Looker SaaS, customers typically need:

- **VPC Service Controls / VPC peering** (GCP)
- **VPN or interconnect** if OpenOps runs outside GCP
- Or a securely exposed PostgreSQL endpoint

Relevant documentation:

- Looker database connections:
  https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/connecting-to-your-database
- Network configuration for Looker-hosted instances:
  https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/looker-hosted-networking

### **Looker Studio**

Looker Studio is SaaS-only and uses public or authorized private connectors.
To connect to PostgreSQL:

- The OpenOps database must be reachable from the public internet **or** available via a secure proxy/connector.
- Many customers use a VPN, bastion host, or a cloud SQL proxy.

# Summary

All external analytics tools follow the same high-level pattern:

1. **Expose OpenOps PostgreSQL** to your analytics environment (preferably privately).
2. **Ensure network access** from the analytics tool (gateway, VPC link, VPN, etc.).
3. **Connect using a PostgreSQL connector** in Power BI, Quick Sight, or Looker.
4. **Select the desired OpenOps tables or views**—including the Opportunity table and any custom tables.

Each product section above links to the official documentation for configuring PostgreSQL connections and describes the most common networking approaches used with that platform.
