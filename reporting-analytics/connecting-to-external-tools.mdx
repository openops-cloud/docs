Many organizations use centralized BI/analytics systems and may want to include data generated by OpenOps in their existing dashboards.

OpenOps stores analytics data in a PostgreSQL database. External analytics tools, such as [AWS Quick Sight](#connecting-aws-quick-sight-to-openops), [Microsoft Power BI](#connecting-microsoft-power-bi-to-openops), or [Google Looker](#connecting-google-looker-to-openops), can connect to this database. Once connected, they can query the same tables and views that power [OpenOps tables](/reporting-analytics/tables), including the *Opportunity* table.

Connecting any external analytics tool to OpenOps consists of two parts.

First, you need to **prepare OpenOps to accept external connections**. This usually means:
* Ensuring the OpenOps PostgreSQL container is reachable from the analytics tool.
* Allowing incoming connections on the PostgreSQL port (`5432`) through your cloud provider’s networking layer (security groups, VPC firewall rules, etc.).
* Optionally configuring a read-only database user for analytics.

Depending on your environment, connectivity may be provided through private VPC networking, VPN, or site-to-site tunnels.

Second, you need to **configure your external analytics tool to connect to PostgreSQL**. This usually involves configuring the OpenOps installation's host and port, database name, authentication method, and selecting the tables or views to visualize. PostgreSQL views corresponding to OpenOps tables follow the naming pattern _table name \_ table id \_ userfriendly_. These are the views that you want to use when setting up connections in external analytics tools.


A specific configuration will vary depending on the analytics tool. See the sections below detailing how to connect to OpenOps from several popular analytics products.

## Connecting AWS Quick Sight to OpenOps

AWS Quick Sight is a fully managed SaaS analytics service. To connect Quick Sight to OpenOps, you must make the OpenOps PostgreSQL database reachable from your AWS account.

Available networking options include:
* [AWS Site-to-Site VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) to your data center or VPC.
* [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/).
* [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) if OpenOps runs inside AWS.
* [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) if exposing PostgreSQL through a private endpoint.

Once network access is available, you can configure Quick Sight to use the OpenOps PostgreSQL database as a data source.

## Connecting Microsoft Power BI to OpenOps

Power BI has two ways to reach on-premises or private-network databases.

If you're using the self-hosted **Power BI Report Server**, it can connect directly to PostgreSQL inside the same LAN/VPC as OpenOps.

If you're using **Power BI Service** SaaS, it cannot directly reach internal databases. Instead, you need to use the [Microsoft On-Premises Data Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-onprem), which should be installed on any machine that can access the OpenOps PostgreSQL port. This gateway acts as a secure bridge between Power BI's cloud service and the local PostgreSQL database.

After connectivity is configured, you create a PostgreSQL data source in Power BI (via the gateway or locally) and select the relevant OpenOps tables.

## Connecting Google Looker to OpenOps

Looker is available as both a fully managed SaaS product and a self-hosted deployment.

Self-hosted Looker can run inside your LAN or VPC and connect directly to your OpenOps PostgreSQL database.

For Looker SaaS to reach a private PostgreSQL instance, you typically use one of the following:
* Allowlisting Looker's outbound IPs and exposing PostgreSQL securely to the internet (TLS, firewall restrictions).
* SSH tunneling, where Looker connects through a bastion host that you manage to the PostgreSQL database.
* Private connectivity in your GCP environment, if OpenOps runs in GCP. Looker can integrate with databases inside your VPC through Google-managed networking.
