<Info>
**OpenOps Slack Bot** is a paid feature. See [pricing](https://www.openops.com/pricing/) for details.
</Info>

The OpenOps Slack Bot lets you interact with OpenOps AI from Slack. Ask about workflows, runs, connections, and FinOps in natural language without leaving your team's workspace.

The bot can help you with:

- **Workflows**: Check what workflows are running, understand how they're built, see what [actions](/workflow-management/actions/) they use, and get help creating or modifying workflows.
- **Workflow runs**: Investigate run status, view history, troubleshoot failures, and understand execution details.
- **FinOps insights**: Ask questions about cloud costs, optimization opportunities, and FinOps best practices.

To talk to the bot from your Slack, you only need to do two things: **connect Slack to OpenOps** from the OpenOps integration page, then **chat with the bot**.

## Prerequisites

- An active OpenOps account with access to at least one [environment](/getting-started/quick-start-guide/).
- A Slack workspace where the OpenOps bot is available.
- Your Slack account linked to OpenOps (see below).

## Connecting Slack to OpenOps

Before you can use the bot in Slack, link your Slack account to OpenOps:

![Connect Slack from OpenOps](/images/paid/slack-connect-integrations.png)

1. Log in to your OpenOps dashboard.
2. Go to **Settings → Integrations**.
3. Click **Connect to Slack**.
4. Complete the authorization in the Slack popup.

<Note>
**First-time workspace installation:** If this is the first time the OpenOps bot is being installed to your Slack workspace, Slack may require approval from your workspace administrator. If you see a message requesting admin approval, you can close the popup. Once your administrator approves the installation, return to OpenOps and click **Connect to Slack** again using the same steps above.
</Note>

Once connected, you can use the bot from Slack.

## Using the bot in Slack

You can interact with the OpenOps bot in two primary ways, plus several other methods for different scenarios.

### Chat in split view

To work in Slack and interact with the bot simultaneously, start a chat that opens on the right-hand side of Slack on desktop or in a browser.

1. From your desktop, click the OpenOps agent or assistant icon in the top right-hand corner of Slack. If there are multiple agents or assistants available, click the **down arrow** to choose the OpenOps bot.
2. Send a message to get started.
3. To view your message history, click the **clock icon**.

**Your first conversation:**

The first time you start a chat in split view:

1. **Environment** – If you have access to more than one environment, the bot asks you to choose one. With a single environment, this step is skipped.
2. **Project** – Next, you choose a project. Again, this is skipped if you only have one.
3. **Response** – The bot confirms and then streams its response in real time.

### Chat from the app's Home tab

You can also start a conversation with the bot from the OpenOps app's Home tab.

1. From your desktop, click **Tools** in the sidebar. If you don't see this option, click **More** to find it.
2. Click **Apps**, then search for and select the OpenOps Bot app.
3. A side pane opens with the app's information. Click **Open app**.
4. Click **New chat** in the top right-hand corner, or click the **Chat tab** to resume a conversation.
5. To view your chat history, click on the **History tab**.

### Other ways to interact

#### @Mention in channels

Mention the bot in any channel where it's installed to start a conversation that everyone in the channel can see. Useful when several people need the same information.

<Note>
**Thread ownership:** Once you start a conversation by @mentioning the bot, the thread is bound to your account. Other users cannot reply in that thread—they'll need to start their own thread with a new @mention to interact with the bot. You can continue the conversation by replying in the same thread, and the bot will maintain context throughout.
</Note>

Example:

@OpenOps Bot What workflows are currently running?

#### "Ask OpenOps Agent" shortcut

![Ask OpenOps Agent shortcut](/images/paid/slack-shortcut-ask-agent.png)

You can send an existing thread to the OpenOps agent for analysis:

1. Right-click (or click the three dots **...**) on a message in the thread.
2. Choose **Shortcuts** → **Ask OpenOps Agent**.
3. In the modal, enter your question about the conversation.
4. Click **Ask**.


## Slash commands

![Slash command example](/images/paid/slack-slash-command.png)

The bot supports slash commands for environment and channel defaults. Responses are **ephemeral** (only you see them).

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/openops-list-environments` | List OpenOps environments linked to your Slack account. |
| `/openops-set-default` | Set the default environment and project for the current channel. |
| `/openops-show-default` | Show the channel's default environment and project. |
| `/openops-clear-default` | Clear the channel default. |

Type the command in the message box in a channel where the bot is installed.

## Channel defaults

Channel defaults set a shared environment and project for a channel so the bot doesn't ask every time.

**Why use them**

- Fewer steps: no environment/project selection for each new conversation.
- Everyone in the channel uses the same environment.
- Reduces mistakes from picking the wrong environment.

**How to set them**

1. Open the channel.
2. Run `/openops-set-default`.
3. Pick the environment and default project.

New conversations in that channel will use these defaults. Existing threads keep the environment and project they started with.

## Stopping bot streaming

While the bot is streaming a reply, a **Stop** button is shown. Click it to stop the response.
