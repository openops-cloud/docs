Most OpenOps features are available in the Community edition, but some are exclusive to the [paid editions](https://www.openops.com/pricing/).

One such feature, available only in the Enterprise edition, is the **sso authentication**.

Community and Professional editions include a basic authentication system. The Enterprise edition lets you integrate OpenOps platform with your identity provider using SAML or OIDC.

In larger organizations, this enables centralized identity and access management, allowing IT and security teams to enforce authentication policies, manage user access through existing identity providers, and streamline onboarding and offboarding.

## Enable SSO for your environment

OpenOps supports Single Sign-On (SSO) through two authentication methods:
- **SAML**
- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**

To learn more or to enable SSO for your environment, please contact your OpenOps account manager.
