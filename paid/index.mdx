TODO rename to "Private Template Catalog"; there's currently no need for an overview page in this section

Most OpenOps features are available in the Community edition, but some only come with the [paid editions](https://www.openops.com/pricing/).

One feature that is only available in the Enterprise edition is the **private template catalog**.

Community and Professional editions come with a [template catalog](/workflow-management/workflow-templates/) that is curated by the OpenOps team. Enterprise Edition enables you to publish your own templates in the private section of the Template Catalog called **My Organization Templates**.

In larger organizations, this enables central FinOps teams to create templates reflecting corporate best practices (such as snooze or escalation policies), then publish them in the private catalog for business units to easily create workflows based on them.

For managed service providers (MSPs), the private template catalog helps define a standard set of templates that can be used to create workflows for new customers.

## Creating a template

Enterprise edition contains a dedicated **Templates** view in the OpenOps main menu:

There are two ways to create a template:
* By clicking **New template** in the top right of the **Templates** view. This opens the template editor, letting you create a template from scratch.
* **From an existing workflow**. When you click the arrow to the right of the workflow name in the workflow editor, a menu displays that contains a **Create template** command:

    Clicking **Create template** duplicates the workflow as a template and opens the resulting template in the template editor.

## Editing a template

The template editor mostly behaves the same way as the [workflow editor](/workflow-management/building-workflows/): you can add and remove steps, edit step properties, test individual steps and the entire template.

There are only a few differences from the workflow editor:
* At the top, there's a **Template editing** header that helps quickly visually distinguish the template editor from the workflow editor.
* The header contains a **View in Catalog** action that previews the last saved version of the template's entry in the template catalog, even if it's not published yet.
* The **Notes** section in the template editor is used as a summary of the template and is displayed in the private template catalog.
* You can't move templates between folders. As opposed to workflows, templates are always in the root folder.
* You can't import and export templates.

## Listing a template in the private catalog

While you're editing the template, its current draft is listed in the **Templates** view.

When you click **Publish** in the template editor, the template is made available in the private template catalog.

## Delisting a template from the private catalog

If you need to delist the template from the private catalog while keeping it in the **Templates** view, do one of the following:
1. In the template's entry in the **Templates** view, click the toggle in the **Visible in catalog** column.
2. In the template editor, click the toggle to the left of the **Publish** button.
