OpenOps is built for FinOps practitioners: engineers, architects, analysts and managers.

It's a No-Code tool and is therefore approachable for practitioners without an extensive technical background. However, it still allows you to "drop into" code whenever you need to.

Here's a rundown of the major features and benefits that OpenOps provides:

* A pre-made [library of FinOps best-practice workflows](/workflow-management/workflow-templates) based on research and input from hundreds of FinOps leaders. The workflows cover various FinOps processes like cost optimization, tagging, budgeting, allocation, and reporting.
* [Building workflows](/workflow-management/building-workflows) from scratch or customization of the pre-made workflows to fit your organization's needs using a No-Code workflow editor based on [Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).
* Out-of-the-box **integrations** with major cloud providers, FinOps platforms, task and project managers, and other relevant tools. These include:
    * **Managed databases**: Amazon RDS, Azure SQL, Google Cloud SQL, Cloud Firestore.
    * **Buckets and storage**: Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage.
    * **Data warehouses and analytics platforms**: Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery.
    * **Cloud cost and optimization tools**: AWS Compute Optimizer, AWS Trusted Advisor, Azure Advisor, Umbrella, Apptio, CloudHealth, Ternary, Archera, CloudHealth, CloudZero.
    * **Communications**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord.
    * **Task and project management tools**: Jira Cloud, Monday, Notion, Asana, Trello.
    * **Version control and IaC**: GitHub, Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager.
* [AI assistance](/ai-assistance/overview/) to help generate CLI commands, SQL queries, and custom code using an LLM provider of your choice: OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and many others.
* Test runs on every step of workflow editing, [workflow version control](/workflow-management/workflow-version-history-lifecycle), and detailed [traceability](/workflow-management/investigate-workflow-run) of every workflow run to make sure that your workflow definitions and runs are reliable.
* [Human-in-the-Loop](/workflow-management/human-in-the-loop) mechanisms to enforce control over critical optimizations. Before running deletions or scale-downs, you can make sure to get oversight and approval from stakeholders using notifications with quick action buttons.
* [Tables](/reporting-analytics) to log opportunities and anomalies in a central location, with options to approve, dismiss, mark as false positive, or snooze. You can also use tables to process billing data, map resources to owners, or generate spend reports.
* [Analytics](/reporting-analytics/data-visualization) to build charts and dashboards based on data in OpenOps tables or your existing data sources, such as CSV files, Google Sheets, Postgres databases, and more.
