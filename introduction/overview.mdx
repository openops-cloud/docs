OpenOps is a No-Code FinOps automation platform. It provides customizable **workflows to automate various FinOps processes**, such as cost optimization, budgeting, forecasting, allocation, and tagging.

At the same time, OpenOps **enables collaboration** of FinOps teams with stakeholders like engineers, DevOps, finance and leadership. It is designed to reduce operational overhead while adapting to complex organizational tooling, business processes, and policies.

OpenOps **integrates** with public cloud providers, third-party FinOps visibility tools, and a wide range of other tools such as collaboration and ticketing services, telemetry systems, and databases. It also provides **AI assistance** using the LLMs you trust to help you build workflows and automate tasks.

OpenOps is available both as a paid managed service and as a free distribution that you can [deploy on premises](/getting-started/system-requirements).

## Why OpenOps?

OpenOps addresses typical **challenges for FinOps practitioners**:
1. Visibility in cloud environments isn't enough. Automation is necessary to ensure end-to-end action and adherence to organizational policies.
2. Automating with internal tools is often inefficient and unsustainable.
3. Automating with off-the-shelf tools lacks flexibility.

While traditional FinOps **visibility tools** are great at surfacing optimization opportunities, they:
* Don't facilitate collaboration between stakeholders in the engineering organization.
* Don't help decide if a flagged resource is actually wasteful or is in fact mission-critical.
* Don't allow implementing opportunities with confidence.

As a result, visibility tools tend to generate false positives and introduce noise. FinOps practitioners find themselves struggling to engage engineers, often facing organizational resistance.

Existing off-the-shelf **automation tools** are way more sustainable and scalable than custom-built automations, but they often lack flexibility when it comes to tailoring automations to the needs of a specific organization.

**OpenOps aims to hit the sweet spot** by being an integrated tool that:
* Consolidates optimization opportunities from native and third-party FinOps visibility tools.
* Knows and suggests ways to apply optimizations.
* Enables easily customizing pre-made optimizations and authoring your own.
* Keeps humans in the loop when deciding which optimizations should be applied.
