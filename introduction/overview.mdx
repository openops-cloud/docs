OpenOps is a No-Code FinOps automation tool.

It supports FinOps practices in large organizations with automated workflows in a way that fosters collaboration across teams.

OpenOps is available both as a paid managed service and as a free distribution that you can [deploy on premises](/getting-started/system-requirements).

## Why OpenOps?

OpenOps addresses typical **challenges for FinOps practitioners**:
1. Visibility in cloud environments isn't enough without automation.
2. Automating with internal tools is often inefficient and unsustainable.
3. Automating with off-the-shelf tools lacks flexibility.

While traditional FinOps **visibility tools** are great at surfacing optimization opportunities, they:
* Don't facilitate collaboration between stakeholders in the engineering organization.
* Don't help decide if a flagged resource is actually wasteful or is in fact mission-critical.
* Don't allow implementing opportunities with confidence.

As a result, visibility tools tend to generate false positives and introduce noise. FinOps practitioners find themselves struggling to engage engineers, often facing organizational resistance.

Existing off-the-shelf **automation tools** are way more sustainable and scalable than custom-built automations, but they often lack flexibility when it comes to tailoring automations to the needs of a specific organization.

**OpenOps aims to hit the sweet spot** by being an integrated tool that:
* Reveals optimization opportunities.
* Knows and suggests ways to apply optimizations.
* Enables easily customizing pre-made optimizations and authoring your own.
* Keeps humans in the loop when deciding which optimizations should be applied.
