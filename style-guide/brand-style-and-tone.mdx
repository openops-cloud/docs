This page provides branding and style standards for OpenOps documentation. It is intended for anyone writing or maintaining documentation within the OpenOps (Beta) project. Following these guidelines ensures a clear, consistent, and professional experience for users and contributors.

## Summary
OpenOps documentation serves FinOps practitioners, cloud/DevOps engineers, SREs, platform and finance teams. Docs range from product overviews through technical guides and snippets. Consistency of branding, language, and formatting is essential for readability and user trust.

## Voice and Tone
- **Professional and concise:** Use the fewest words necessary.
- **Action-oriented:** Guide the user with commands and steps.
- **Neutral and clear:** Avoid marketing phrases and excessive adjectives.
- **Audience-aware:**
    - For non-technical users: explain abbreviations, offer step-by-step instructions, and include more explanations.
    - For technical audiences: use direct, practical language; assume familiarity with FinOps, AWS, Azure, GCP; focus on code/examples.

## Formatting Standards
- **One primary purpose per page.** Open with a 1-2 sentence summary describing what and who the page is for.
- **Front matter:** All docs require YAML front matter with fields: `title`, `description`, `icon`, and `iconType`. Optional fields include `slug`, `tags`, `draft`, `sidebar_order`, and `hide_toc`.
- **Heading structure:**
    - Title is typically present only in front matter, not repeated as H1 in the body
    - H2 for major sections (e.g., Purpose, Prerequisites, Examples)
    - H3 for detailed subtopics or step groups
    - Title Case for all headings
- **Lists:** Use bullets for unordered lists, no punctuation at the end of items, Oxford comma for series.
- **Code and examples:**
    - Inline code using backticks (`)
    - Code blocks use language tags for syntax highlighting
    - Provide example inputs/outputs where feasible; include comments for complex tasks
    - Place runnable code near the page top where possible
    - Use codetabs for platform-specific variants

## Branding Conventions
- Product names and acronyms appear as OpenOps (Beta), FinOps, AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
- Use fictional values for sensitive data (e.g., `<YOUR_API_KEY>`)
- Avoid all-caps except for acronyms
- Prefer absolute internal links starting with `/`; keep link text descriptive

## Common Patterns
- Short focused pages: each file addresses a single concept or operational need
- One clear outcome per how-to, snippet, or reference page
- Consistent use of front matter and metadata for navigation and search
- Emphasize troubleshooting and validation in guides

## Release Notes Style
- Use emojis for release category headers (üöÄ Features, üêõ Fixes, ‚ú® Improvements)
- Describe breaking changes under a prominent "‚ö†Ô∏è NOTICE" block as shown in the template

## Example Front Matter
```yaml
---
title: "<Page Title>"
description: "<Short purpose description>"
icon: "<icon-name-or-emoji>"
iconType: "emoji|svg|font"
slug: "/path/if/needed"
tags: ["category", "topic"]
draft: false
sidebar_order: 10
hide_toc: false
