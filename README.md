## What is OpenOps?

OpenOps is a **No-Code FinOps automation platform** that helps organizations **reduce cloud costs** and **streamline financial operations**. It provides **customizable workflows** to automate key FinOps processes like **cost optimization, tagging, budgeting, allocation, and reporting**.

At the same time, OpenOps **enables collaboration** between **FinOps teams, engineers, DevOps, finance, and leadership**, ensuring that cost-saving measures are not just identified but effectively implemented.

OpenOps **integrates seamlessly** with cloud providers, third-party FinOps tools, collaboration platforms, and project management services.

## Key Features

- **Pre-Built FinOps Workflows** – A library of best-practice workflows designed with input from hundreds of FinOps leaders. Covers cost optimization, tagging, budgeting, allocation, and reporting.
- **No-Code Experience** – Approachable for non-technical practitioners, but allows "dropping into" code when needed.
- **Flexible Workflow Editor** – Build workflows from scratch or customize existing ones using a No-Code interface powered by [Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).
- **Seamless Integrations** – Connects with cloud providers, databases, analysis tools, communication platforms, and project management systems.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Controls** – Enforce oversight for critical operations with approval workflows.
- **Workflow Versioning & Traceability** – Test workflow steps, maintain workflow version control, and track every action with detailed logs.
- **Centralized Management** – Log and process opportunities with tables that allow approvals, dismissals, false-positive marking, and snoozing.

## Why OpenOps?

FinOps practitioners struggle with **visibility tools** that surface cost-saving opportunities but lack implementation capabilities. Traditional automation tools, whether **custom-built** or **off-the-shelf**, fail to balance flexibility and maintainability.

OpenOps solves these challenges by:

- **Consolidating** optimization opportunities from native and third-party FinOps visibility tools.
- **Suggesting** practical optimization actions.
- **Enabling customization** of pre-built optimizations or authoring new ones.
- **Keeping humans in the loop** for critical cost decisions.

With OpenOps, organizations can **automate cloud cost optimization with confidence**, ensuring that FinOps processes are efficient, actionable, and aligned with business goals.
