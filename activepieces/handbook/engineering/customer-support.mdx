## How to talk to customers?

- Chat with them like you're talking to a friend. No need to sound like a robot. For example:
  - ✅ "Hey there! How can I help you today?"
  - ❌ "Greetings. How may I assist you with your inquiry?"
  - ✅ "No worries, we'll get this sorted out together!"
  - ❌ "Please hold while I process your request."
- Reply quickly! People love fast responses. Even if you don't know the answer right away, let them know you'll get back to them with the info. This is the fastest way to make customers happy; everyone likes to be heard.
- Explain the issue clearly and don't be defensive and be honest. We're all about open source and transparency here – it's part of our culture. For example:
  - ✅ "I'm sorry, I forgot to follow up on this. Let's get it sorted out now."
  - ❌ "I apologize for the delay, there were unforeseen circumstances."
