## Disabling host validation

By default, OpenOps does not allow workflows to call internal/private network addresses such as `127.0.0.1` or `192.168.0.0`. This affects HTTP and SMTP actions, as well as webhook triggers. Host validation protects users from creating workflows that could accidentally or maliciously access internal services, scan networks, or escalate privileges.

You may need to disable this check in certain circumstances, such as in non-production deployments or where workflows intentionally interact with internal-only infrastructure.

To disable host validation, open the `.env` file in your installation folder and set the `OPS_ENABLE_HOST_VALIDATION` environment variable to `false`.

<Warning>Disabling this check removes an important safety guard and may allow workflows to access internal infrastructure. Use caution and avoid disabling in production.</Warning>
