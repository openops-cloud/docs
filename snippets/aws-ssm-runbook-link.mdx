## Generating an AWS SSM runbook execution link

Use the AWS action Generate Runbook Execution Link to build a Console URL you can share or open:

1. Add the AWS action Generate Runbook Execution Link
2. Region is optional. If empty, it uses the region from your AWS connection
3. Choose Owner to filter runbooks (Amazon, Self, Private, Public, Third Party, or All)
4. Pick Runbook. The list is loaded from AWS Systems Manager for the selected owner/region
5. Optionally select Version. If empty, the default document version is used
6. Fill Parameters. The form adapts to the selected runbook’s schema
7. Test the step. The output contains a link field you can pass to Slack or open in a browser

Example output link:

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/automation/execute/AWS-RestartEC2Instance?region=us-east-1&documentVersion=1#InstanceId=i-1234567890abcdef
