Open the `.env` file in the OpenOps installation folder. Change the values of the following variables that represent credentials. Do it now, as you won't be able to change these values after the initial deployment:
* `OPS_OPENOPS_ADMIN_EMAIL`: the email of your OpenOps installation's root admin account.
* `OPS_OPENOPS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: the password of your OpenOps installation's root admin account.
* `OPS_POSTGRES_USERNAME`: the username of the Postgres database that OpenOps uses.
* `OPS_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password of the Postgres database that OpenOps uses.
* `OPS_ANALYTICS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: the password of the [OpenOps Analytics](/reporting-analytics/data-visualization/) admin account (the username is hardcoded to `admin`).
