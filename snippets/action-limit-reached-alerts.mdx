During workflow test runs, OpenOps will display an alert if you reach the configured action limit for a workflow. This alert helps prevent excessive or unintended executions when designing automations.

## Purpose
OpenOps restricts the total number of actions that can execute in a single workflow run for safety and cost control. When this limit is reached during testing, an on-screen alert appears with details and a link to the current action limit settings.

## Behavior
- When the action limit is reached:
  - You see an in-app alert warning "Action limit reached" during the workflow test run
  - A settings panel or link allows you to adjust the limit if needed
- No further actions in the workflow will execute after the limit is hit
- You can re-test after modifying the action limit

## How to Configure Action Limits

1. Open a workflow in the designer
2. Start a test run
3. If the alert appears, click the provided configuration link
4. Adjust the "Action limit per run" value to a safe maximum for your workflow

## Example

```plaintext
Action limit reached
You have triggered the maximum number of actions for this workflow run. To change this limit, go to: Workflow Settings > Action limits
```

## Troubleshooting
- If your workflow is unexpectedly halted, check if you hit the action limit
- Increase the limit only if you understand the action count and associated cloud costs
- For bulk operations, consider using batch actions or splitting the workflow
