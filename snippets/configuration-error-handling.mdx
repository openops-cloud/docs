OpenOps users may occasionally encounter configuration errors when setting up workflows, integrations, or cloud access. This page summarizes how to recognize, diagnose, and resolve common configuration issues.

## Purpose
This guide helps practitioners detect and fix configuration problems across OpenOps deployments.

## Common Configuration Errors
- Missing or invalid API keys (`Missing API key: Set OPENOPS_API_KEY in your environment`)
- Incorrect cloud provider credentials (`AccessDenied: Not authorized to perform action`)
- Workflow references to undefined connections or resources
- Syntax mistakes in YAML or JSON configuration files
- Invalid field names, types, or missing required options
- Outdated templates referencing deprecated actions or APIs

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Validate Inputs**
   - Check that all required fields are defined and correctly typed.
   - Review environment variables such as `OPENOPS_API_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and connection IDs.
2. **Check Error Messages**
   - Carefully read the full error output. Key details usually appear near the start or after a failed step.
3. **Review Logs**
   - Use the workflow run viewer in OpenOps to inspect logs for failed steps and trace configuration paths.
4. **Confirm Permissions**
   - Ensure your cloud/user credentials have adequate permissions for all required actions (see [Access Levels & Permissions](/cloud-access/access-levels-permissions)).
5. **Update Outdated Resources**
   - Replace any deprecated actions or API fields referenced in your workflow configuration.
   - Refer to the release notes before upgrading OpenOps.
6. **Validate Configuration Files**
   - Use a linter or validator for YAML/JSON, or leverage IDE syntax checking features.

## Example: Invalid API Key

**Symptom:**
```
Error: Missing API key: Set OPENOPS_API_KEY in your environment
```
**Solution:**
- Export your API key in the shell before running OpenOps:
```bash
export OPENOPS_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```
- Or, add it to your environment variable configuration file (e.g., `.env`).

## Validation
- After correcting configuration issues, rerun the operation to confirm resolution.
- Check workflow status and ensure all steps complete without error.

## Troubleshooting
If errors persist after checking configurations, consult full logs and verify environment settings. For advanced debugging, review OpenOps version compatibility and update dependencies as required.
