This page explains how the OpenOps UI handles authentication when it is not required by the application.

## Summary
When authentication is optional or explicitly not required, the OpenOps user interface allows users to access permitted features without prompting for sign-in. This behavior improves usability for public or low-security deployments while maintaining clear boundaries for protected features.

## Behavior Details
- If authentication is set to `null` or not configured, UI protected routes or components will check for this condition and will not require login for access.
- Features that do not require authentication are fully accessible without user credentials.
- Features that are sensitive or require authentication will still enforce login, regardless of global auth settings.

## Example Scenario
Suppose you run OpenOps in a test environment with authentication disabled:

- The home dashboard, read-only data tables, and public reports remain accessible to all users.
- Creating new workflows or modifying cloud integrations (protected actions) will continue to prompt for authentication if required by site policy.

## Troubleshooting
If a user-facing component incorrectly requests authentication when it's optional:
- Ensure `auth` configuration is explicitly set to `null` or omitted.
- Confirm you are using a compatible version of OpenOps (see [System Requirements](/getting-started/system-requirements)).
- Review application logs for authentication middleware overrides.
