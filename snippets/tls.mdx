## Enabling TLS

For production usage, itâ€™s recommended to enable TLS (HTTPS). In addition to the security aspect, this also ensures that [workflow templates](/workflow-management/workflow-templates/) load properly in all browsers.

The easiest way to enable TLS is to use an OpenOps script that requests and sets up a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt. Before running the script, make sure you have a domain name that points to your {target}'s external IP address. If you're configuring DNS right before running the script, you may need to wait for the DNS change to propagate.

1. Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```shell
    curl -fsS https://openops.sh/tls | sh
    ```
2. When prompted, enter a domain name that points to the external IP address of your {target}.
3. When prompted, enter an email address to receive certificate-related notifications from Let's Encrypt.

The script will use the Certbot library to request a certificate for your domain from Let's Encrypt. It receives and saves the certificate, updates the OpenOps configuration file accordingly, and restarts OpenOps.

By default, the certificate expires in 3 months. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup if you want to configure auto-renewal.
