## Enabling TLS

For production usage, it's recommended to enable TLS (HTTPS). In addition to the security aspect, this also ensures that [workflow templates](/workflow-management/workflow-templates/) load properly in all browsers.

### Automatically

The easiest way to enable TLS is to use an OpenOps script that requests and sets up a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt. Before running the script, make sure you have a domain name that points to your {target}'s external IP address. If you're configuring DNS right before running the script, you may need to wait for the DNS change to propagate.

1. Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```shell
    curl -fsS https://openops.sh/tls | sh
    ```
2. When prompted, enter a domain name that points to the external IP address of your {target}.
3. When prompted, enter an email address to receive certificate-related notifications from Let's Encrypt.

The script will use the Certbot library to request a certificate for your domain from Let's Encrypt. It receives and saves the certificate, updates the OpenOps configuration file accordingly, and restarts OpenOps.

By default, the certificate expires in 3 months. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup if you want to configure auto-renewal.

### Manually

While the script is offered as a convenient way to quickly set up TLS, you're more than welcome to create a certificate yourself. You can use Let's Encrypt DNS validation (rather than the HTTP validation the script is doing), or request a certificate from a different provider.

To set up TLS manually:

1. Obtain your TLS certificate and private key files from your certificate provider.
2. Upload the certificate files to your OpenOps installation under the `tls` directory:
    - `~/openops/tls/cert.pem` (certificate file)
    - `~/openops/tls/key.pem` (private key file)
3. Edit the `.env` file in your OpenOps installation directory and update the following variables:
    ```shell
    OPS_NGINX_CONFIG_FILE=nginx.gateway.tls.conf
    OPS_PUBLIC_URL=https://openops.example.com
    ```
    Replace `https://openops.example.com` with your actual secure URL.
4. Restart the Docker containers:
    ```shell
    sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
