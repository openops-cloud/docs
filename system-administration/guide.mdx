_System administration in OpenOps involves managing users, roles, platform settings, and ensuring ongoing system health._ This guide is designed for platform and DevOps teams that configure and maintain OpenOps environments.

## Purpose
This guide outlines what OpenOps system administrators do and provides actionable steps for performing common administrative tasks.

## Prerequisites
- You have access to the OpenOps platform as an administrator
- You are familiar with the [OpenOps platform Overview](/README.md)

## Core Responsibilities
- Manage user accounts and permissions
- Configure system-wide settings and integrations
- Monitor platform status and handle system events
- Schedule platform maintenance, updates, and backups
- Apply security policies such as password standards, MFA, and access reviews

## Key Tasks and Procedures

### 1. Managing Users and Roles
- Add, modify, or remove users from the system
- Assign roles for fine-grained access control using the OpenOps UI or automation workflows
- Review audit logs for user activity

### 2. Configuring Platform Settings
- Update core configuration, such as notification channels or integration endpoints
- Apply environment variables as needed for workflows

#### Example: Configuring a Dynamic Variable for Object Key Resolution
As of October 2025, OpenOps supports dynamic variable resolution for object keys in workflows.

```yaml
# Example: Using a workflow variable to select an object key dynamically
object_lookup:
  key: "${user.selected_key}"
```
This enables referencing runtime values in workflow logic, improving automation flexibility.

### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Review system health dashboards regularly
- Use built-in tools to restart or troubleshoot system components
- Schedule regular backups for configuration and workflow states

### 4. Security and Compliance
- Enforce least-privilege principles with role-based access
- Audit workflows and connections for compliance
- Review integration scopes and API key usage

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- Review recent logs in the admin dashboard
- Restart affected services using admin tools if workflows hang
- Contact support if platform issues persist
