# AWS Billing and Cost Management MCP Server Integration

This guide describes how to deploy and configure the AWS Billing and Cost Management Multi-Cloud Provider (MCP) Server in OpenOps, enabling automated collection and analysis of AWS cost and billing data within your FinOps workflows.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with IAM permissions for Billing and Cost Management
- Docker installed on host/server
- OpenOps deployed and accessible
- API credentials for OpenOps (see [README](/README.md))
- Network access to AWS APIs from the MCP container

## Installation

### Docker Setup
The AWS Billing MCP Server can be deployed as a container alongside other OpenOps services. Update your Docker Compose file to include the `aws-billing-mcp` service:

```yaml
services:
  aws-billing-mcp:
    image: openops/aws-billing-mcp:latest
    environment:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <your-access-key>
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <your-secret-key>
      AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: <aws-region>
    ports:
      - "8088:8080" # Adjust as needed
    restart: unless-stopped
```

- Replace environment variable values with your AWS credentials.
- Confirm that the network configuration allows outbound calls to AWS APIs.

### API Tool Initialization
To enable API-driven access to AWS billing data, initialize the MCP API tool by registering its endpoint with OpenOps:

```json
POST /api/v1/tools/register
{
  "name": "aws-billing-mcp",
  "endpoint": "http://aws-billing-mcp:8080/api",
  "type": "billing-provider"
}
```

**Request Example:**
```http
POST /api/v1/tools/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "aws-billing-mcp",
  "endpoint": "http://aws-billing-mcp:8080/api",
  "type": "billing-provider"
}
```
**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "tool-123",
  "status": "registered"
}
```

## Usage

Once registered, workflows and automation within OpenOps can access AWS Billing and Cost Management data via the MCP server's API. Example usage within a workflow action:

```json
{
  "tool": "aws-billing-mcp",
  "operation": "fetch-cost-summary",
  "parameters": {
    "timePeriod": {
      "start": "2025-10-01",
      "end": "2025-10-15"
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

1. Confirm the container is running:
    ```bash
    docker ps | grep aws-billing-mcp
    ```
2. Test direct API connectivity:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8088/api/health
    ```
    Expected response:
    ```json
    { "status": "ok" }
    ```
3. Check workflow logs in OpenOps for successful billing data fetches.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid AWS Credentials:** Ensure IAM keys are correct and have billing read permissions
- **Connection Issues:** Confirm ports and network settings in Docker Compose
- **API Registration Fails:** Verify container endpoint is reachable from the OpenOps API server
