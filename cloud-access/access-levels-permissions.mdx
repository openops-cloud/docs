Although some workflows can be performed without direct access to cloud resources, the power of automations that you build in OpenOps depends on the permissions that you assign. That said, you control which level of access to provide, as needed by the workflows that you build. One strategy is to start with providing OpenOps read-only permissions, and when you're ready to automate update operations, provide more permissions.

Access to cloud resources in OpenOps is defined using "connections": sets of resource credentials. OpenOps provides a separate tab to list and create connections:

![Connections](/images/access-connections.png)

Each workflow can use one or more connections, including multiple connections per resource. For example, you can have one connection for read-only AWS access and a different connection for updates.

You can set up connections in two ways:
1. Upfront by going to the **Connections** tab and clicking **New Connection**. This opens a pop-up that lets you first select a connection type:
    ![Connection types](/images/access-connection-types.png)
2. While editing the workflow, in action properties, by opening the **Connection** dropdown and clicking **Create Connection**:
    ![Creating a connection from workflow properties](/images/access-connection-from-workflow.png)

## AWS connections

In OpenOps, AWS connections are used for actions that access **AWS** resources, as well as for **AWS Athena**, **AWS CloudFormation**, and **AWS Compute Optimizer** actions.

You can choose one of two approaches to configure connections to your AWS resources:
1. [**Using access keys**](#connecting-using-access-keys): a pair consisting of an access key ID and a secret access key.
2. [**Using an IAM role attached to the EC2 instance**](#connecting-using-an-iam-role-attached-to-your-ec2-instance) where OpenOps is hosted. This is a more secure approach and is recommended for production use. However, it requires that OpenOps is [hosted on an AWS EC2 instance](/getting-started/deployment/aws-ec2/).

Whichever approach you choose, you'll need to specify the default AWS region for the connection. If your AWS account doesn't already have a default region, you can [set it in the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/change-default-region.html) separately.

### Connecting using access keys

This approach requires specifying your access key ID, secret access key, and the default region in the AWS connection properties:

![AWS connection](/images/access-aws-connection.png)

You can [create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) in the AWS Management Console. When you do, you'll get an access key ID and a secret access key to enter in the AWS connection configuration form. The specific set of permissions you assign to the user depends on what you want to do in the workflows that will use the AWS connection. For example, if you want your workflow to turn off EC2 instances, assign the `ec2:StopInstances` permission as shown in [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_ec2_tag-owner.html).

If you have multiple AWS accounts and want one of them to define all the permissions that may be needed for workflows defined by [OpenOps templates](/workflow-management/workflow-templates/), consider installing the [OpenOpsApp AWS Role Stack](/cloud-access/aws-cf-role-stack/). Even if you don't, you can [download the stack](https://openops.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/OpenOpsAppRoleStack.yml) and use it as a reference when configuring permissions for your workflows.

### Connecting using an IAM role attached to your EC2 instance

If you host OpenOps [on an AWS EC2 instance](/getting-started/deployment/aws-ec2/), you can use an IAM role attached to the instance instead of access keys. This is a more secure approach and is recommended for production use of OpenOps.

Here's what you need to do:

1. If your EC2 instance doesn't already have an IAM role attached, attach one by following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/attach-iam-role.html).
2. Open the `.env` file in your OpenOps installation directory. Inside the file, set the `OPS_AWS_ENABLE_IMPLICIT_ROLE` variable to `true`.
3. <RestartContainers/>
4. Create an AWS connection in OpenOps. In the connection properties, leave the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** fields empty, and specify the default region. The connection will now automatically use the IAM role attached to your EC2 instance.

### Connecting to multiple AWS accounts

OpenOps supports two approaches for working with multiple AWS accounts.

If you prefer to work with each account separately, you can create an AWS connection for each account [using AWS access keys](#connecting-using-access-keys). In this case, each connection should include that account's access key ID, secret access key, and default region. You can then assign different connections to different workflow actions.

If you want to access multiple accounts together (for example, create a workflow that finds EC2 instances in multiple accounts), you can connect to the accounts from a single OpenOps connection. One account would have to have an assume-role trust with the other accounts. It is common to use the "payer" account in an organization for that purpose. To configure the connection in OpenOps:

1. In the AWS connection UI, configure a connection to your central account using [access keys](#connecting-using-access-keys) or [an IAM role attached to your EC2 instance](#connecting-using-an-iam-role-attached-to-your-ec2-instance). This account must have permission to assume roles in the other accounts.
2. In the **Roles** section, click **Add Item**.
3. For each additional AWS account you want to connect to, specify:
   * **Assume role ARN**: the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the IAM role to assume in this account (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/OpenOpsExecutionRole`).
   * **Assume role external ID**: a shared secret defined in the IAM role's trust policy. Leave this field blank if the role does not require an external ID.
   * **Account alias**: a convenience label used to identify this account in your workflows (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `billing`).

You can add multiple entries in the **Roles** section to manage many accounts. When configuring a workflow, you'll be able to choose which account to use with each action.

## Azure connections

A connection to Azure requires specifying your application (client) ID, client secret, and directory (tenant) ID:

![Azure connection](/images/access-azure-connection.png)

If you don't already have these credentials, you can acquire them by creating an Azure service principal. There are two ways to do this: with the [Azure CLI](#creating-an-azure-service-principal-using-the-azure-cli) or the [Azure Portal](#creating-an-azure-service-principal-using-the-azure-portal).

Alternatively, instead of creating a connection, you can use your [local Azure CLI credentials](#using-local-azure-cli-credentials).

### Creating an Azure service principal using the Azure CLI

Run the following Azure CLI command to create an Azure application and a service principal with the "Contributor" role at the subscription level:

```shell
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "SomeAppName"
```

If you'd rather assign a different role to the service principal, specify the role using the `--role` flag instead. For example, this command assigns the "Reader" role to the service principal:

```shell
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "SomeAppName" --role "Reader"
```

Whichever role you choose, the command returns JSON output similar to the following:

```json
{
  "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "displayName": "<SomeAppName>",
  "password": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

Copy the values from the output into the respective fields in OpenOps connection properties:
* `appId` to **Application (client) ID**
* `password` to **Client Secret**
* `tenant` to **Directory (tenant) ID**

### Creating an Azure service principal using the Azure Portal

1. From the Azure Portal home screen, go to **App registrations** and click **New registration** to create a new application:
    ![Creating a new registration](/images/access-azure-portal-registrations.png)
2. In the **Overview** section of the new application, you should now see the client ID and tenant ID. Copy these values into OpenOps.
3. Go to the **Certificates & Secrets** submenu and create a new secret. Copy the secret to OpenOps now, as it will only be shown once.
4. Go to the **Subscriptions** page and select a subscription for your new application's service principal.
5. Under the selected subscription, click **Access control (IAM)** on the left-side menu bar. In the view that opens, click **Add**, then select **Add role assignment**:
    ![Adding a role assignment](/images/access-azure-portal-sponsorships.png)
6. In the **Role** step, select the role that you want your Azure connection to have. For a safe testing experience, use "Reader" or another read-only role. If you want to enable OpenOps to make changes to your Azure assets, choose "Contributor" or a more privileged role.
7. In the **Members** step, click **Select members** and specify the name of your application. If your application does not appear in the dropdown immediately, search for it by name.
    ![Assigning members to the selected role](/images/access-azure-portal-role-access.png)
8. Click **Review + assign**.

Your service principal is now ready to be used with your Azure connection in OpenOps.

### Using local Azure CLI credentials

If you're running the Azure CLI on the same machine as your OpenOps installation, you can share your local Azure CLI session with OpenOps instead of creating a connection. To do this, open the `.env` file in your OpenOps installation directory and set the following environment variables:

* `OPS_ENABLE_HOST_SESSION=true` to enable sharing of the host session with the OpenOps container.
* `HOST_AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=/root/.azure` to define the path to the host machine's Azure configuration folder that will be shared with the OpenOps container.

Before running OpenOps, log in to Azure using the CLI:
```shell
sudo az login
```

## Google Cloud connections

There are two ways to connect to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) from OpenOps:
* [Using a service account](#connecting-with-a-gcp-service-account)
* [Using local GCP CLI credentials](#using-local-google-cloud-cli-credentials)

### Connecting with a GCP service account

A connection to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) requires creating a [GCP service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) with permissions to use GCP services that you want OpenOps to interact with.

![Google Cloud Platform connection](/images/access-gcp-connection.png)

Once you have created a service account and exported a JSON service account key file, paste the contents of the file into the **Key file content** field, save the connection, and you're good to go.

### Using local Google Cloud CLI credentials

If you're running the Google Cloud CLI on the same machine as your OpenOps installation, you can share your local CLI session with OpenOps instead of creating a connection. To do this, open the `.env` file in your OpenOps installation directory and set the following environment variables:
* `OPS_ENABLE_HOST_SESSION=true` to enable sharing of the host session with the OpenOps container.
* `HOST_CLOUDSDK_CONFIG=/root/.config/gcloud` to define the path to the host machine's Google Cloud configuration folder that will be shared with the OpenOps container.

Before running OpenOps, log in to Google Cloud using the CLI:
```shell
sudo gcloud auth login
```
