OpenOps needs access to your cloud resources to perform its workflows. The level of access will depend on what exactly your workflow does.

Access to cloud resources in OpenOps is defined using "connections": sets of resource credentials. OpenOps provides a separate tab to list and create connections:

Each workflow can use one or more connections, including multiple connections per resource: for example, one connection for read-only AWS access and a different connection for updates.

You can set up connections in two ways:
1. Upfront by going to the **Connections** tab and clicking **New Connection**. This opens a pop-up that lets you first select a connection type:

2. While editing the workflow, in action properties, by opening the **Connection** dropdown and clicking **Create Connection**:

## AWS connections

Generally the permissions directly correlates to whatever the user wants to do in their workflows. If they want to turn off EC2 instances, they need the EC2 StopInstance permission, etc.
To create the actual AWS IAM user and access key , we need to point them to the relevant guide in AWS I imagine.

* AWS: access key ID, secret access key, default region, roles (assume role ARN, assume role external ID, account alias)
* AWS Athena: see AWS
* AWS CloudFormation: see AWS
* AWS Compute Optimizer: see AWS

## Azure connections

* Azure: Azure AD OAuth 2.0 (application (client) ID, client secret, directory (tenant) ID). The application (client) ID determines the permissions granted in the Azure Portal.
