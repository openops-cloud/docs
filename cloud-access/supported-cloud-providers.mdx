OpenOps supports the big three cloud providers: [AWS](#aws), [Azure](#azure), and [Google Cloud](#google-cloud).

[Actions](/workflow-management/actions/) in each cloud provider's block are implemented using the respective provider's official APIs.

You can create workflows [across cloud providers](#automating-across-multiple-cloud-providers) if you're using more than one of them.

## AWS

AWS actions use the latest available AWS CLI at the time of OpenOps installation.

The full list of AWS actions is as follows:

<AWS/>

Here's an example of a step in an AWS workflow that retrieves EBS volumes. For each volume, the workflow proceeds to determine its unit cost:

* [Setting up AWS connections](/cloud-access/access-levels-permissions#aws-connections)
* [Iterating over multiple AWS accounts](/cookbook/iterate-over-multiple-aws-accounts)

## Azure

Azure actions use the Azure CLI version 2.74.0, with the following extensions preinstalled:
* *reservation*
* *resource-graph*
* *costmanagement*
* *billing-benefits*
*quotas*
* *ssh*.

Dynamic extension installation is allowed, meaning that if you use the Azure CLI action to run a command that is not available in the preinstalled extensions, the action will install the necessary extension automatically.

The full list of Azure actions is as follows:

<Azure/>

Here's an example of a step in an Azure workflow that fetches Azure Advisor cost recommendations pertaining to a specific resource group:

* [Setting up Azure connections](/cloud-access/access-levels-permissions#azure-connections)
* [Iterating over multiple Azure subscriptions](/cookbook/iterate-over-multiple-azure-subscriptions)

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud actions use the Google Cloud SDK version 516.0.0, with Beta versions of CLI commands enabled.

The full list of Google Cloud actions is as follows:

<GCP/>

Here's an example of a step in a Google Cloud workflow that retrieves Google Cloud recommendations for a specific combination of a project and a recommender. The workflow then proceeds to analyze and act on each recommendation:

## Automating across multiple cloud providers

If you're using multiple cloud providers, you can structure your workflows so that OpenOps provides automations across all of them. You can either combine actions related to multiple cloud providers in one workflow or have separate provider-specific workflows save findings to a central location, such as an OpenOps table.

Using [OpenOps tables](/reporting-analytics/tables/), you can aggregate findings and recommendations across cloud providers into a single table, where you can track approval status or group potential savings by business unit.

You can see how it works by using the three sample workflows for AWS, Azure and Google Cloud that your OpenOps instance suggests in the **Overview** view:
<NarrowImage src="/images/multicloud-sample-workflows.png" alt="Sample workflows for AWS and Azure" />

These workflows collect recommendations from AWS Compute Optimizer, Azure Advisor, and Google Cloud Recommenders, respectively, and then log the recommendations to a single preconfigured [**Opportunities** table](/reporting-analytics/tables#opportunities). If you're using multiple clouds, you can structure your workflows in a similar way.
