When you deploy OpenOps for the first time, it creates an admin user account. The email and password for the account are defined in two variables in your `.env` file:
* `OPS_OPENOPS_ADMIN_EMAIL`
* `OPS_OPENOPS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

The admin user account created this way has exactly one distinction: it can be used to create other user accounts.

## Creating new user accounts

OpenOps doesn't currently provide a UI for creating user accounts; instead, you can do it with two API calls.

The first API call is to sign in the admin user:

```http
POST http://your-openops-installation/api/v1/authentication/sign-in
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "your-admin-email",
  "password": "your-admin-password"
}
```

This call returns a JSON object that contains a property called `token`. The token is a time-limited JWT that you use to authenticate subsequent API calls.

Copy the value of the `token` property and use it in the authorization header in the next call. This next call actually creates a new user account. Before making the call, in the body, don't forget to specify actual values for the four properties that are left empty in the sample below:

```http
POST http://your-openops-installation/api/v1/authentication/sign-up
Authorization: Bearer your-admin-token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "password": "",
  "email": "",
  "firstName": "",
  "lastName": "",
  "trackEvents": false,
  "newsLetter": false
}

```

The user account that you create this way is an editor account. It can perform all operations in OpenOps except for creating new user accounts. Every time you create a new user, you still need an admin token.
