When you deploy OpenOps for the first time, it creates an admin user account. The email and password for the account are defined in two variables in your `.env` file:
* `OPS_OPENOPS_ADMIN_EMAIL`
* `OPS_OPENOPS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

The admin user account created this way has exactly one distinction: it can be used to create other user accounts.

## Password requirements

User passwords must:
* Be 8-64 characters long.
* Include only alphanumeric characters and the following special characters: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};':"\|,.<>/?`

## Creating new user accounts

OpenOps doesn't currently provide a UI for creating user accounts; instead, you can do it with two API calls.

The first API call is to sign in the admin user:

```shell
POST http://your-openops-installation/api/v1/authentication/sign-in
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "your-admin-email",
  "password": "your-admin-password"
}
```

This call will return a JSON object that contains a property called `token`. Copy the value of this property and use it in the authorization header in the next call. This next call actually creates a new user account. Before making the call, in the body, don't forget to specify actual values for the four properties that are left empty in the sample below:

```shell
POST http://your-openops-installation/api/v1/authentication/sign-up
Authorization: Bearer your-admin-token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "password": "",
  "email": "",
  "firstName": "",
  "lastName": "",
  "trackEvents": false,
  "newsLetter": false
}

```

The user account that you create this way will be able to perform all operations in OpenOps except for creating new user accounts. Every time you do that, you'll still need an admin token.
