The open source version of OpenOps is meant to be deployed on-premises and is distributed as a Docker Compose specification.

## Hardware

Hardware requirements vary depending on your use case. There are two primary groups of use cases:
* **Exploring OpenOps and building automations**. For these purposes, 2 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, and 50GB storage should be sufficient.
* **Production use and running your automations**. For this scenario, aim at 4 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and 100GB storage.

## Operating systems

OpenOps can be deployed on the following operating systems:
* **Linux**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later, Debian 11 (Bullseye) or later, Fedora 35 or later.
* **macOS**: macOS Big Sur (11.x) or later.
* **Windows**: Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or later, or Windows 11.

## Docker

OpenOps is distributed as a Docker Compose file. Here are Docker version requirements by operating system:
* On Linux: **Docker Engine v20.10+ and Docker Compose v2.x**.
* On macOS: **Docker Desktop 4.11 or later**. If you're running macOS on an Apple Silicon processor (M1 or M2), open Docker Desktop settings, and in the *General* tab, scroll down to the *Virtual Machine Options* section. Once there, make sure that:
    1. *Apple virtualization framework* is selected for *Virtual Machine Manager*.
    1. The *Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon* option is enabled.
* On Windows: **Docker Desktop 4.11 or later**. In your Docker Desktop settings, in the *General* tab, enable the *Use the WSL 2 based engine* option.

If you're using an alternative Docker client such as OrbStack or Colima, make sure that the version of your Docker client includes Docker Engine v20.10+ and Docker Compose v2.x.
