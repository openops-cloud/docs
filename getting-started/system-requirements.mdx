description: 'Hardware and software requirements for deploying OpenOps on-premises'
---

The open source version of OpenOps is meant to be deployed on-premises and is distributed as a Docker Compose specification.

## Hardware

Hardware requirements vary depending on whether you intend to explore and test OpenOps, or deploy it in production.

**For testing**, 1 CPU core, 2GB RAM, and 50GB storage should be sufficient.

**For production**, aim at 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, and 100GB storage.

## Operating systems

OpenOps can be deployed on the following operating systems:
* **Linux**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later, Debian 11 (Bullseye) or later, Fedora 35 or later.
* **macOS**: macOS Big Sur (11.x) or later.
* **Windows**: Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or later, or Windows 11.

## Docker

OpenOps is distributed as a Docker Compose file. Here are Docker version requirements by operating system:
* On Linux: **Docker Engine v20.10+ and Docker Compose v2.x**.
* On macOS: **Docker Desktop 4.11 or later**. If you're running macOS on an Apple Silicon processor (M1 or M2), make sure that QEMU emulation is use in  Docker Desktop.
* On Windows: **Docker Desktop 4.11 or later**. Docker Desktop should be configured to use WSL 2 (check Docker Desktop settings under *General > Use the WSL 2 based engine*).

If you're using an alternative Docker client such as OrbStack or Colina, make sure that the version of your Docker client includes Docker Engine v20.10+ and Docker Compose v2.x.

## Ports

By default, OpenOps uses the following ports on the host machine: 80, 3001, 3002, 3005, 5432, and 6379.

If any of these ports are already assigned, update OpenOps' `docker-compose.yaml` file to use different ports.

For example, if you'd like to access OpenOps at `localhost:3333` instead of `localhost`, update the `ports` section of the `openops-app` service definition in `docker-compose.yaml` the following way:

```diff
services:
  openops-app:
    container_name: openops-app
    image: public.ecr.aws/openops/openops-app:0.1.1
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      OPS_COMPONENT: app
    ports:
-      - 80:80
+      - 3333:80
```
