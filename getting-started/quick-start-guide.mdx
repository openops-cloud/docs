Here's how you can go from downloading the open source distribution of OpenOps to starting getting value out of your OpenOps deployment.

## Deploy OpenOps on your local machine

You don't need a beefy machine for a test deployment, and any modern OS will do. You'll need Docker though, so see [system requirements](system-requirements) to make sure you have a compatible version of a Docker client.

Once you know your machine meets the system requirements:
1. Go to the [OpenOps Releases](https://github.com/openops-cloud/workflow-editor/releases) page on GitHub and download `docker-compose-release-{version}.zip` from the latest release.
2. Unzip the file to a new directory with a semantic name: for example, `openops-installation`.
3. Inside the directory, make a copy of the `.env.defaults` file and save it as `.env`.
4. Open the `.env` file and find two variables that represent admin credentials: `OPS_OPENOPS_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `OPS_OPENOPS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Change the values of these variables.
5. Make sure your Docker client such as Docker Desktop is running (if you're deploying on Linux, you don't need this).
6. Inside the `openops-installation` directory, open a terminal and perform the following command to download Docker images:
    ```shell
   docker compose pull
    ```
    Wait until all images are pulled:
    ![All images are pulled](/images/qsg-pulled.png)
7. To launch OpenOps, run this in your terminal:
    ```shell
   docker compose up -d
    ```
    Wait until all volumes are created, and all containers are either `Healthy` or `Started`:
    ![Containers and volumes are ready](/images/qsg-containers-volumes.png)

## Open OpenOps in your browser

Your OpenOps instance is now available at http://localhost/, so go ahead and open it in your browser:

You can now log in with the admin account credentials that you've updated in the `.env` file.

## Look around

After logging in, the first thing you'll see is the OpenOps **Overview** view:
![Initial screen](/images/qsg-initial-screen.png)

The sidebar containing the main OpenOps navigation menu is collapsed by default, but you can show it by clicking the book icon on the top left:
![Sidebar](/images/qsg-sidebar.png)

The other views are mostly empty at this point, but it helps to know that they're around:
* **Workflows** will let you keep track of the workflows that you create.
* **Runs** will keep a history of executing your workflows, indicating start time and status.
* **Connections** will list all permissions you provide to OpenOps for various cloud providers and services, as well as let you create new ones.
* **Tables** will store data and collected by workflows, as well as any information you enter or import to guide your workflows.

## Run a sample workflow

Back in **Overview**, OpenOps suggests two sample beginner-level workflows to help you get a feel of the product. Click **AWS sample workflow**:
![AWS sample workflow](/images/qsg-aws-sample-workflow.png)

When the workflow preview pop-up displays, click **Use template** in the top right corner:
![AWS sample workflow - use template](/images/qsg-aws-workflow-preview.png)

Run one of the two sample workflows and see results in the Opportunity table. FYI the new home page has a Get Started panel with links to the samples workflows and some doc pages + Community page
