Here's how you can go from downloading the open source distribution of OpenOps to starting getting value out of your OpenOps deployment.

## Deploying OpenOps

You don't need a beefy machine for a test deployment, and any modern OS will do. You'll need Docker though, so see [system requirements](system-requirements) to make sure you have a compatible version of a Docker client.

Once you know your machine meets the system requirements:
1. Go to the [OpenOps Releases](https://github.com/openops-cloud/workflow-editor/releases) page on GitHub and download `docker-compose-deployment.zip` from the latest release.
2. Unzip the file.
3. TODO see https://github.com/openops-cloud/workflow-editor/blob/main/README.md#creating-new-users on how to create the admin user
4. Make sure your Docker client such as Docker Desktop is running (if you're deploying on Linux, you don't need this).
5. Run `docker compose up -d`
