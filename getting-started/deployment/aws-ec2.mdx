This guide explains how to install the OpenOps Docker Compose release on a newly created EC2 instance.

It assumes you have appropriate permissions on an existing AWS account.

## Initial deployment

### Create a new EC2 instance

1. On the EC2 home page, click **Launch Instance**:

2. Choose a name for your instance and configure the following settings:
    * **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**
        - Choose **Ubuntu** as the instance image, as it simplifies Docker installation. Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS was the latest available version when this guide was written.
        - Keep **64-bit (x86)** as the instance architecture.
    * **Instance Type**. The *t3.large* instance type provides decent performance. You can choose a different type according to your needs, but it's not recommended to select a size smaller than *t3.medium*.
    * **Key Pair**. Creating a new SSH key pair is recommended but not mandatory.
    * **Network Settings**. Allow SSH traffic from your own IP address:

    * **Configure Storage**. Choose **50GB** to ensure you have enough space for Docker images and databases.
3. Launch the instance and navigate to it once it's created by clicking on the instance ID.

4. Configure the network settings and open the necessary ports. Under **Security**, click on the security group.

    Click **Edit inbound rules**, then **Add rule**, and add two rules:
    1. In the first rule, for **Type**, choose **HTTP**, and under **Source**, select **My IP**.
    2. In the second rule, for **Type**, choose **SSH**. Click the text box next to **Source**, and select the prefix list that contains the words “ec2-instance-connect". The full name should be similar to `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ec2-instance-connect`, depending on your region. This allows you to connect to the instance via AWS CloudShell.

    The final rules should look like this:

5. Click **Save rules** to finish the configuration.

### Connect to the instance with CloudShell

1. Navigate to your EC2 instance and click **Connect** to open an in-browser CloudShell session.

2. Click **Connect** and wait for CloudShell to initialize.

### Automatically install OpenOps

Run the following command to install, configure and run OpenOps:

```shell
    curl -fsSL https://openops.sh/install | sh
```

### Manually install OpenOps

Alternatively, you can follow the manual installation steps:

1. Install the `unzip` utility:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install unzip
    ```
2. In CloudShell, create a new directory and download the release files:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops && \
    wget https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.2.6/openops-dc-0.2.6.zip && \
    unzip -o openops-dc-0.2.6.zip && cp --update=none .env.defaults .env
    ```
3. Update the application URL to use the instance’s public IP address:
    ```shell
    sed -i 's/http:\/\/localhost/http:\/\/'$(wget -4qO - https://ifconfig.io/ip)'/g' .env
    ```
4. Edit the `.env` file with *vim* or another editor according to your needs. It's highly recommended to change the default passwords.
5. Install Docker using Snap:
    ```shell
    sudo snap install docker
    ```
6. Pull the images and start the Docker containers:
    ```shell
    sudo COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
    If you encounter a rate limit, rerun the pull command. Note that pulling images may take several minutes.

You can now access the OpenOps application by navigating to the public IP address of your EC2 instance (e.g., `http://20.20.20.20`). The login credentials are configured in the `.env` file. If unchanged, the default username is `admin@openops.com`, and the password is `please-change-this-password-1`.

## External databases

To use external PostgreSQL or Redis databases, modify the relevant variables in the `.env` file. You can disable the corresponding containers by adding a profile in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
![Disabling a profile](/images/deploy-aws-external-db.png)

After making changes, restart the Docker Compose containers:
```shell
sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
```

## TLS

For production usage, it’s recommended to enable TLS (HTTPS). You can achieve this by adding an EC2 Load Balancer to serve traffic to your EC2 instance.

Without TLS, cloud templates may not load properly when using the Safari browser.
