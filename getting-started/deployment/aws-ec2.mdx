This guide explains how to install the OpenOps Docker Compose release on a newly created EC2 instance.

It assumes you have appropriate permissions on an existing AWS account.

## Initial deployment

### Create a new EC2 instance

1. On the EC2 home page, click **Launch Instance**:
    <NarrowImage src="/images/deploy-aws-launch-instance.png" alt="Launch instance" />
2. Choose a name for your instance and configure the following settings:
    * **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**
        - Choose **Ubuntu** as the instance image, as it simplifies Docker installation. Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS was the latest available version when this guide was written.
        - Keep **64-bit (x86)** as the instance architecture.
    * **Instance type**. The *t3.large* instance type provides decent performance. You can choose a different type according to your needs, but it's not recommended to select a size smaller than *t3.medium*.
    * **Key pair (login)**. Creating a new SSH key pair is recommended but not mandatory.
    * **Network settings**. Allow SSH traffic from your own IP address:
      ![Network settings](/images/deploy-aws-network-settings.png)
    * **Configure storage**. Choose **50GB** to ensure you have enough space for Docker images and databases.
3. In the **Summary** section on the right, click **Launch instance**:
    <NarrowImage src="/images/deploy-aws-launch-instance-2.png" alt="Launch instance" />
4. Once the instance is launched, navigate to instance details by clicking the instance ID:
    ![Instance launched](/images/deploy-aws-instance-launched.png)
5. Configure the network settings and open the necessary ports:
    1. Open the **Security** tab, then click on the security group.
    ![Security tab](/images/deploy-aws-security.png)
    2. Click **Edit inbound rules**.
    3. Add two new rules by clicking **Add rule** each time:
        1. In the first rule, for **Type**, choose **HTTP**, and under **Source**, select **My IP**.
        2. In the second rule, for **Type**, choose **SSH**. Click the text field next to **Source**, and search for `ec2-instance-connect`. Select the prefix list with the full name similar to `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ec2-instance-connect`, depending on your region. This allows you to connect to the instance via AWS CloudShell.
            ![Prefix lists](/images/deploy-aws-prefix-lists.png)
        The resulting set of inbound rules should look like this:
        ![New inbound rules](/images/deploy-aws-inbound-rules.png)
    4. Click **Save rules** to finish the configuration.

### Connect to the instance with CloudShell

1. Back in the instance details view of your EC2 instance, and click **Connect**.
    <NarrowImage src="/images/deploy-aws-connect.png" alt="Connect" />
2. In the **Connect** view, use default connection settings and click **Connect** again, then wait for CloudShell to initialize an in-browser session.

### Install OpenOps

<AutoInstall/>

Alternatively, you can follow the manual installation steps:

<Expandable title="Installing OpenOps manually">
1. Install the `unzip` utility:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install unzip
    ```
2. In CloudShell, create a new directory and download the release files:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops && \
    wget https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.6.10/openops-dc-0.6.10.zip && \
    unzip -o openops-dc-0.6.10.zip && cp --update=none .env.defaults .env
    ```
3. Update the application URL to use the instance's public IP address:
    ```shell
    sed -i 's/http:\/\/localhost/http:\/\/'$(wget -4qO - https://ifconfig.io/ip)'/g' .env
    ```
4. <UpdateCredentials/>
5. Install Docker using Snap:
    ```shell
    sudo snap install docker
    ```
6. Pull the images and start the Docker containers:
    ```shell
    sudo COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
    If you encounter a rate limit, rerun the pull command. Note that pulling images may take several minutes.

If you did not update credentials in the `.env` file, the default username is `admin@openops.com` and the password is `please-change-this-password-1`.
</Expandable>

You can now access the OpenOps application by navigating to the public IP address of your EC2 instance (e.g., `http://20.20.20.20`).

## External databases

To use external PostgreSQL or Redis databases, modify the relevant variables in the `.env` file. You can disable the corresponding containers by adding a profile in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
postgres:
  profiles: ['disabled']
  image: 'postgres:14.4'
  container_name: 'postgres'
```

After making changes, restart the Docker Compose containers:
```shell
sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
```
