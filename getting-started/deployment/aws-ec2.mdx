This guide explains how to install the OpenOps Docker Compose release on a newly created EC2 instance.

It assumes you have appropriate permissions on an existing AWS account.

## Initial deployment

### Create a new EC2 instance

1. On the EC2 home page, click **Launch Instance**:
    ![Launch instance](/images/deploy-aws-launch-instance.png)
2. Choose a name for your instance and configure the following settings:
    * **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**
        - Choose **Ubuntu** as the instance image, as it simplifies Docker installation. Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS was the latest available version when this guide was written.
        - Keep **64-bit (x86)** as the instance architecture.
    * **Instance Type**. The *t3.large* instance type provides decent performance. You can choose a different type according to your needs, but it's not recommended to select a size smaller than *t3.medium*.
    * **Key Pair**. Creating a new SSH key pair is recommended but not mandatory.
    * **Network Settings**. Allow SSH traffic from your own IP address:
      ![Network settings](/images/deploy-aws-network-settings.png)
    * **Configure Storage**. Choose **50GB** to ensure you have enough space for Docker images and databases.
3. Launch the instance and navigate to it once it's created by clicking on the instance ID.

4. Configure the network settings and open the necessary ports. Under **Security**, click on the security group.
    ![Security tab](/images/deploy-aws-security.png)
    Click **Edit inbound rules**, then **Add rule**, and add two rules:
    1. In the first rule, for **Type**, choose **HTTP**, and under **Source**, select **My IP**.
    2. In the second rule, for **Type**, choose **SSH**. Click the text box next to **Source**, and select the prefix list that contains the words “ec2-instance-connect". The full name should be similar to `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ec2-instance-connect`, depending on your region. This allows you to connect to the instance via AWS CloudShell.
        ![Prefix lists](/images/deploy-aws-prefix-lists.png)
    The final rules should look like this:
    ![New inbound rules](/images/deploy-aws-inbound-rules.png)
5. Click **Save rules** to finish the configuration.

### Connect to the instance with CloudShell

1. Navigate to your EC2 instance and click **Connect** to open an in-browser CloudShell session.
    ![Connect](/images/deploy-aws-connect.png)
    ![Connect to instance](/images/deploy-aws-connect-to-instance.png)
2. Click **Connect** and wait for CloudShell to initialize.

### Download OpenOps release files

1. Install the `unzip` utility:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install unzip
    ```
2. In CloudShell, create a new directory and download the release files:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops && \
    wget https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.2.5/openops-dc-0.2.5.zip && \
    unzip -o openops-dc-0.2.5.zip && cp --update=none .env.defaults .env
    ```
3. Update the application URL to use the instance's public IP address:
    ```shell
    sed -i 's/http:\/\/localhost/http:\/\/'$(wget -4qO - https://ifconfig.io/ip)'/g' .env
    ```

Feel free to edit the `.env` file with *vim* or another editor according to your needs. It's highly recommended to change the default passwords.

### Install Docker and start the containers

1. Install Docker using Snap:
    ```shell
    sudo snap install docker
    ```
2. Pull the images and start the Docker containers:
    ```shell
    sudo COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
    If you encounter a rate limit, rerun the pull command. Note that pulling images may take several minutes.

You can now access the OpenOps application by navigating to the public IP address of your EC2 instance (e.g., `http://20.20.20.20`). The login credentials are configured in the `.env` file. If unchanged, the default username is `admin@openops.com`, and the password is `please-change-this-password-1`.

## External databases

To use external PostgreSQL or Redis databases, modify the relevant variables in the `.env` file. You can disable the corresponding containers by adding a profile in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
![Disabling a profile](/images/deploy-aws-external-db.png)

After making changes, restart the Docker Compose containers:
```shell
sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
```

## Enabling TLS (HTTPS) access with a load balancer

For production usage, it's recommended to enable TLS (HTTPS). Without TLS, cloud templates may not load properly when using the Safari browser.

To secure OpenOps with TLS, it's recommended to place your EC2 instance behind an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB). This setup uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to handle TLS, and allows secure access via a DNS name, even without a [custom domain](#accessing-openops-via-a-custom-domain-over-tls).

<Warning>Once the ALB is in place, all access should go through it — you can no longer use the EC2 public IP directly.</Warning>

### Request a TLS certificate in ACM

1. Go to the [AWS Certificate Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home) (ACM).
2. Request a public certificate for your EC2's public DNS name (e.g., `ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com`).
3. Choose **DNS validation** and wait for the certificate to be **Issued**.

<Tip>Assign an elastic IP to your EC2 instance to prevent its IP from changing over time.</Tip>

### Create an Application Load Balancer

1. In the **EC2 > Load Balancers** section, click **Create Load Balancer**.
2. Choose **Application Load Balancer**, and configure the following:
    * **Scheme**: Internet-facing
    * **Listeners**:
        * Add a listener for **HTTPS (443)** using the ACM certificate.
        * Optionally, add a listener on port **80** with a rule to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
3. Under **Security Groups**, create a security group that allows inbound traffic on **port 443**.
4. Create a target group:
    * **Target type**: Instance
    * **Protocol**: HTTP
    * **Port**: 80
    * **Health check path**: `/api/v1/health`
5. Register your EC2 instance as a target.
6. Finish creating the ALB and wait for its status to become **Active**.

Once setup is complete, you'll be able to access OpenOps securely at `https://your-alb-dns-name.elb.amazonaws.com`.

### Update environment and restart

1. SSH into your EC2 instance or use CloudShell.
2. Update the public OpenOps URL in the `.env` file:
    ```env
    OPS_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-alb-dns-name.elb.amazonaws.com
    ```
3. Restart the containers:
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter a 503 error:
* Ensure you restarted Docker containers after updating `.env`.
* Confirm that the ALB's health check is configured with the correct path (`/api/v1/health`).
* Make sure the EC2 instance's security group allows traffic from the ALB.
* Look for more cues in the Nginx container logs:
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose logs nginx
    ```

## Accessing OpenOps via a custom domain over TLS

If you want to access your OpenOps instance via a custom domain (e.g., `https://openops.your-company.com`), you'll need to configure DNS and update your TLS certificate to cover that domain.

Before you start, make sure to [enable HTTPS with a load balancer](#enabling-tls-https-access-with-a-load-balancer) as described above.

### Create a DNS record

1. In **Route 53** (or your DNS provider), create a DNS record:
    * **Name**: `openops.your-company.com`
    * **Type**: `A` (Alias) or `CNAME`
    * **Value**: The DNS name of your ALB (such as `https://your-alb-dns-name.elb.amazonaws.com`)
2. Save and wait for DNS changes to propagate.

### Request an ACM certificate for your domain

1. Go to the [AWS Certificate Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home) (ACM).
2. Request a new certificate for `openops.your-company.com`.
3. Validate the domain using DNS. If you're using Route 53, ACM can create the necessary records automatically.
4. After validation, attach the certificate to your ALB via its HTTPS listener.

### Update OpenOps configuration

1. SSH into your EC2 instance or use CloudShell.
2. Update the `.env` file to reflect your new domain:
    ```env
    OPS_PUBLIC_URL=https://openops.your-company.com
    ```
3. Restart the containers:
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```

You can now access OpenOps at your custom domain using HTTPS.
