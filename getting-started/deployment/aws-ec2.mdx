This guide explains how to install the OpenOps Docker Compose release on a newly created EC2 instance.

It assumes you have appropriate permissions on an existing AWS account.

## Initial deployment

### Create a new EC2 instance

1. On the EC2 home page, click **Launch Instance**:
    ![Launch instance](/images/deploy-aws-launch-instance.png)
2. Choose a name for your instance and configure the following settings:
    * **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**
        - Choose **Ubuntu** as the instance image, as it simplifies Docker installation. Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS was the latest available version when this guide was written.
        - Keep **64-bit (x86)** as the instance architecture.
    * **Instance Type**. The *t3.large* instance type provides decent performance. You can choose a different type according to your needs, but it's not recommended to select a size smaller than *t3.medium*.
    * **Key Pair**. Creating a new SSH key pair is recommended but not mandatory.
    * **Network Settings**. Allow SSH traffic from your own IP address:
      ![Network settings](/images/deploy-aws-network-settings.png)
    * **Configure Storage**. Choose **50GB** to ensure you have enough space for Docker images and databases.
3. Launch the instance and navigate to it once it's created by clicking on the instance ID.

4. Configure the network settings and open the necessary ports. Under **Security**, click on the security group.
    ![Security tab](/images/deploy-aws-security.png)
    Click **Edit inbound rules**, then **Add rule**, and add two rules:
    1. In the first rule, for **Type**, choose **HTTP**, and under **Source**, select **My IP**.
    2. In the second rule, for **Type**, choose **SSH**. Click the text box next to **Source**, and select the prefix list that contains the words “ec2-instance-connect". The full name should be similar to `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ec2-instance-connect`, depending on your region. This allows you to connect to the instance via AWS CloudShell.
        ![Prefix lists](/images/deploy-aws-prefix-lists.png)
    The final rules should look like this:
    ![New inbound rules](/images/deploy-aws-inbound-rules.png)
5. Click **Save rules** to finish the configuration.

### Connect to the instance with CloudShell

1. Navigate to your EC2 instance and click **Connect** to open an in-browser CloudShell session.
    ![Connect](/images/deploy-aws-connect.png)
    ![Connect to instance](/images/deploy-aws-connect-to-instance.png)
2. Click **Connect** and wait for CloudShell to initialize.

### Automatically install OpenOps

<AutoInstall/>

### Manually install OpenOps

Alternatively, you can follow the manual installation steps:

1. Install the `unzip` utility:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install unzip
    ```
2. In CloudShell, create a new directory and download the release files:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops && \
    wget https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.3.2/openops-dc-0.3.2-test.zip && \
    unzip -o openops-dc-0.3.2-test.zip && cp --update=none .env.defaults .env
    ```
3. Update the application URL to use the instance's public IP address:
    ```shell
    sed -i 's/http:\/\/localhost/http:\/\/'$(wget -4qO - https://ifconfig.io/ip)'/g' .env
    ```
4. <UpdateCredentials/>
5. Install Docker using Snap:
    ```shell
    sudo snap install docker
    ```
6. Pull the images and start the Docker containers:
    ```shell
    sudo COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
    If you encounter a rate limit, rerun the pull command. Note that pulling images may take several minutes.

You can now access the OpenOps application by navigating to the public IP address of your EC2 instance (e.g., `http://20.20.20.20`). If you did not update credentials in the `.env` file, the default username is `admin@openops.com` and the password is `please-change-this-password-1`.

## External databases

To use external PostgreSQL or Redis databases, modify the relevant variables in the `.env` file. You can disable the corresponding containers by adding a profile in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
![Disabling a profile](/images/deploy-aws-external-db.png)

After making changes, restart the Docker Compose containers:
```shell
sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
```

## Configuring TLS (HTTPS) and a custom domain

For production usage, it’s recommended to enable TLS (HTTPS). In addition to the security aspect, this also ensures that [workflow templates](/workflow-management/workflow-templates/) load properly in all browsers.

TLS requires configuring a custom domain (e.g., `https://openops.your-company.com`) to serve your OpenOps installation instead of its public IP address.

To get a custom domain with TLS up and running, you need to set up an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a valid TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), then create a new DNS record and update your OpenOps configuration.

### Request an ACM certificate

1. Open the [ACM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home).
2. Request a public certificate for your domain (e.g., `openops.your-company.com`).
3. Validate the domain using DNS. If you're using Route 53, ACM can create the necessary records automatically.
4. Wait until the certificate status changes to **Issued**.

### Create an Application Load Balancer

<Warning>Once the ALB is in place, all access should go through it — you can no longer use the EC2 public IP directly.</Warning>

1. In the **EC2 > Load Balancers** section, click **Create Load Balancer**.
2. Choose **Application Load Balancer**, and configure the following:
    * **Scheme**: Internet-facing
    * **Listeners**:
        * Add a listener for **HTTPS (443)** using the ACM certificate.
        * Optionally, add a listener on port **80** with a rule to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
3. Under **Security Groups**, create a security group that allows inbound traffic on **port 443**.
4. Create a target group:
    * **Target type**: Instance
    * **Protocol**: HTTP
    * **Port**: 80
    * **Health check path**: `/api/v1/health`
5. Register your EC2 instance as a target.
6. Finish creating the ALB and wait for its status to become **Active**.

### Create a DNS record

1. In **Route 53** (or your DNS provider), create a DNS record:
    - **Name**: `openops.your-company.com`
    - **Type**: `A` (Alias) or `CNAME`
    - **Value**: The DNS name of your ALB (for example, `openops-alb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`)
2. Save and wait for DNS changes to propagate.

### Update OpenOps configuration

1. SSH into your EC2 instance or use CloudShell.
2. Update the `.env` file to reflect your new domain:
    ```env
    OPS_PUBLIC_URL=https://openops.your-company.com
    ```
3. Restart the containers:
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter a 503 error:
- Ensure you restarted Docker containers after updating `.env`.
- Confirm that the ALB's health check is configured with the correct path (`/api/v1/health`).
- Make sure the EC2 instance's security group allows traffic from the ALB.
- Look for more cues in the Nginx container logs:
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose logs nginx
    ```
