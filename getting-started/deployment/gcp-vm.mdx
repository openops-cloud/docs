This guide explains how to install the OpenOps Docker Compose release on a newly created GCP Compute Engine VM instance.

It assumes you have appropriate permissions on an existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project.

## Initial deployment

### Create a new VM instance
1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **Compute Engine** → **VM instances**.
2. Click **Create Instance**.
3. Enter a name for your virtual machine.
4. Under **Machine configuration**, configure the following:
    - **Region and zone**: Choose a region and zone close to your users (e.g., `us-east1-b`).
    - **Series**: Choose any recommended series (e.g., **E2**) or another family you prefer.
    - **Machine type**: Choose a machine size similar to **e2-standard-2** or larger. Avoid very small machines, as OpenOps may need additional CPU/RAM for running Docker containers smoothly.

5. Under **OS and storage**:
    - Click **Change**.
    - Select **Ubuntu** as the operating system (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS if available, or a close alternative).
    - Increase the **Size** to at least 50GB to accommodate Docker images and databases.
    - Click **Select**.

6. Under **Networking**, check **Allow HTTP traffic**. This will automatically create a firewall rule to open port 80.

7. Leave other settings as defaults (or adjust according to your preferences), then click **Create** to launch the VM.

### Configure firewall for SSH and HTTP

Depending on your project settings, a default firewall rule might already allow SSH access. By checking **Allow HTTP traffic** while creating the instance, HTTP (port 80) is also open. If you need to adjust or review these rules:

1. In the **VPC network** menu, go to **Firewall**.
2. Locate or create firewall rules for:
    - **SSH** (TCP/22) from your IP or a limited source range.
    - **HTTP** (TCP/80) for public access or your desired source range.

### Connect to the instance

1. Once your VM is running, go to the **VM instances** list.
2. Click **SSH** next to your instance to open an in-browser terminal.

### Automatically install OpenOps

Run the following command to install, configure and run OpenOps:

```shell
    curl -fsSL https://openops.sh/install | sh
```

### Manually install OpenOps

Alternatively, you can follow the manual installation steps:

1. Install the `unzip` utility:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install unzip
    ```
2. In your SSH session, create a new directory and download the release files:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops
    wget https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.2.6/openops-dc-0.2.6.zip
    unzip -o openops-dc-0.2.6.zip
    cp -u .env.defaults .env
    ```
3. Update the application URL to use the instance’s external IP address:
    ```shell
    EXTERNAL_IP=$(curl -4 -s ifconfig.co)
    sed -i "s|http://localhost|http://$EXTERNAL_IP|g" .env
    ```
4. Edit the `.env` file with **vim** or another editor. It’s highly recommended to change the default passwords.
5. Install Docker (for Ubuntu):
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo systemctl start docker
    ```
6. Install Docker Compose (using `docker compose` plugin):
    ```shell
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/
    sudo curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.6/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
    ```
7. Pull the images and start the Docker containers:
    ```shell
    sudo COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
    If you encounter rate limits, rerun the pull command. Pulling images may take several minutes.

You can now access the OpenOps application by navigating to the external IP address of your VM (e.g., `http://<YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP>`). The login credentials are configured in the `.env` file. If unchanged, the default username is `admin@openops.com`, and the password is `please-change-this-password-1`.

## External databases

To use external PostgreSQL or Redis databases, modify the relevant variables in the `.env` file. You can disable the corresponding containers by adding a profile in the `docker-compose.yml` file, for example:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    profiles: ["db"]
```

If you remove or disable the `db` profile in `.env` or in Docker Compose, that container won’t start. After making any changes, restart Docker Compose:

```shell
sudo docker compose down
sudo docker compose up -d
```

## TLS

For production usage, it’s recommended to serve the application over HTTPS. One way to achieve this on GCP is by using a HTTPS Load Balancer to terminate SSL/TLS and forward traffic to your VM. Alternatively, you can configure a TLS proxy or run a reverse proxy like Nginx with Certbot on your VM.

Without TLS, some features (such as certain cloud templates) may not load properly in Safari.
