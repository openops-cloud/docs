This guide explains how to install the OpenOps docker-compose release on a local machine. Note that these settings are for testing purposes only and not for a production environment.

Before following the instructions, make sure that your machine meets the [system requirements](/getting-started/system-requirements) for OpenOps.

## Installing OpenOps

<AutoInstall/>

This script supports macOS, Ubuntu and Windows (via WSL2 Ubuntu).

If you can't use the autoinstall script, follow the manual installation steps for your operating system below.

<Expandable title="Installing manually on macOS">
### On macOS

1. Install Docker Desktop by following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).
2. Open a new terminal window and run the following command to create a folder and download the OpenOps release files:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops && \
    curl -OL https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.4.3/openops-dc-0.4.3.zip && \
    unzip openops-dc-0.4.3.zip && cp -n .env.defaults .env
   ```
3. <UpdateCredentials/>
4. Pull the images and run `docker compose`:
    ```shell
    COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull
    docker compose up -d
   ```
    If you face a rate limit while downloading, run the command again.

You can now access the application by navigating to http://localhost.

### On Ubuntu Server

<Note>This procedure has been tested on Ubuntu Server 24.04.</Note>

1. During the Ubuntu Server installation, select Docker to be added to the installation. If you need to install Docker later, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
2. Log in to your server and run the following commands to create a folder and download the OpenOps release files:
    ```shell
    # create and change directory
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops
    # download the release file
    curl -OL https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.4.3/openops-dc-0.4.3.zip
    # refresh package lists
    sudo apt update
    # install unzip
    sudo apt install unzip
    # decompress release file
    unzip openops-dc-0.4.3.zip
    # copy the defaults to env without overwriting existing files
    cp --update=none .env.defaults .env
    ```
3. Identify your own IP address:
    ```shell
    # find IP address
    ip -o -4 addr show | awk '{print $2, $4}'
    ```
    The output should look something like this:
    ```shell
    lo 127.0.0.1/8 # loopback network interface - not here
    enp1s0 192.168.1.50/24 # this looks more like it. We want this inet IP address without the subnet mask: 192.168.1.50
    docker0 172.17.0.1/16 # docker network interface - not here
    ```
    In this case, the IP address is `192.168.1.50`.
4. <UpdateCredentials/>
5. In the `.env` file, find the `OPS_PUBLIC_URL` variable and replace its value, `http://localhost`, with the IP address that you've previously identified. In our example, the IP address would be `http://192.168.1.50`.
6. Pull the images and run `docker compose`:
    ```shell
    # download the docker volumes and images
    COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 sudo docker compose pull
    # launch the application
    sudo docker compose up -d
   ```
    If you face a rate limit while downloading, run the command again.

<Expandable title="Installing manually on Windows">
### On Windows (with PowerShell)

1. Install Docker Desktop by following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).
2. Add a new folder for OpenOps in your PowerShell console:
    ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path openops
   Set-Location openops
    ```
3. Download the OpenOps release files:
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.4.3/openops-dc-0.4.3.zip"
    Expand-Archive -Path "openops-dc-0.4.3.zip" -DestinationPath .
    if (-Not (Test-Path ".env")) {
        Copy-Item ".env.defaults" ".env"
    }
    ```
4. <UpdateCredentials/>
5. Run `docker compose`:
    ```powershell
    $env:COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT = "4"
    docker compose pull
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    If you face a rate limit while downloading, run the command again.

## Cloud templates

On localhost, cloud templates may not be able to load when using the Safari browser.

## Configuring Slack approvals

If you would like to run a workflow that uses Slack approvals in a local installation, you should set the following variable in your `.env` file:

```shell
OPS_SLACK_ENABLE_INTERACTIONS=false
```

<Note>This will open a new tab in your default browser when you approve or reject an action. You can safely close the tab after the action is completed.</Note>

After updating your `.env` file, restart the containers:

```shell
sudo docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

## Using Azure CLI in workflows: running with local credentials

It is possible to share your local session with the platform for local applications.
To do this, you need to set two environment variables in the `.env` file under the installation folder:
* `OPS_ENABLE_HOST_SESSION=true`: enables sharing of the host session with the platform container.
* `HOST_AZURE_CONFIG_DIR="~/.azure"`: defines the path to the host machine's Azure configuration folder that will be shared with the platform container.


## Support

Feel free to join our [Slack community](https://slack.openops.com) if you have any questions or need help with the installation.
