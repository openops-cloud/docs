This guide explains how to install the OpenOps docker-compose release on a local machine. Note that these settings are for testing purposes only and not for a production environment.

## On macOS

### Install Docker Desktop

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/) to install Docker Desktop.

### Run docker compose

1. Open a new Terminal window and run the following command to create a folder and download the OpenOps release files:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops && \
    curl -OL https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.2.1/openops-dc-0.2.1.zip && \
    unzip openops-dc-0.2.1.zip && cp -n .env.defaults .env
   ```
2. Pull the images and run docker compose. If you face a rate limit while downloading, run the command again.
    ```shell
    COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull
    docker compose up -d
   ```

You can now access the application by navigating to http://localhost. The login credentials are configured in the `.env` file, the default username is "admin@openops.com" and the default password is "please-change-this-password-1".

## On Ubuntu Server 24.04

### Install docker

During the Ubuntu server installation, select docker to be added to the installation. Otherwise, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

### Run docker compose

1. Log in to your server and run the following commands to create a folder and download the OpenOps release files:
    ```shell
    # create and change directory
    mkdir -p openops && cd openops
    # download the release file
    curl -OL https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.2.1/openops-dc-0.2.1.zip
    # refresh package lists
    sudo apt update
    # install unzip
    sudo apt install unzip    
    # decompress release file
    unzip openops-dc-0.2.1.zip
    # copy the defaults to env without overwriting existing files
    cp --update=none .env.defaults .env
    ```
2. Identify your own IP address
    ```shell
    # find IP address
    ip -o -4 addr show | awk '{print $2, $4}'
    ```
    Identify your IP address. The output should look something like this
    ```shell
    lo 127.0.0.1/8 # loopback network interface - not here
    enp1s0 192.168.1.50/24 # this looks more like it. We want this inet IP address without the subnet mask: 192.168.1.50
    docker0 172.17.0.1/16 # docker network interface - not here
    ```
    In this case, the IP address is 192.168.1.50

3. Update the local OPS_PUBLIC_URL
    Important: change the .env **before** launching the application
    ```shell
    # edit .env file. You can use any other console text editor such as vim.
    nano .env
    ```
    Use Ctrl+W or the cursor buttons to navigate to the entry OPS_PUBLIC_URL
    Replace http://localhost with your domain or IP address, in this case http://192.168.1.50
    Ctrl+x, Y, and Enter to save the modified file.

4. Pull the images and run docker compose. If you face a rate limit while downloading, run the command again.
    ```shell
    # download the docker volumes and images
    COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 sudo docker compose pull
    
    # launch the application
    sudo docker compose up -d
   ```

## Updating your version

First, stop the running containers:
```shell
sudo docker compose down
```

To update your OpenOps docker compose installation, unzip the new release into the same location where you initially installed it:
```shell
curl -OL https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.2.1/openops-dc-0.2.1.zip && \
unzip -o openops-dc-0.2.1.zip
```

You can then restart the application and fetch the new images:
```shell
COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && docker compose up -d
```

## Cloud Templates

On localhost, cloud templates may not be able to load when using the Safari browser.

## Configuring Slack Approvals

If you would like to run a workflow that uses Slack approvals, please follow the steps:
1. Download and create a free account in [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
2. Start ngrok 
```shell
ngrok http http://localhost
```
3. Copy the Forwarding address
![Copy the Forwarding address](/images/ngrok-public-address.png)
4. Go to the OpenOps installation directory
5. Inside the directory, make a copy of the `.env.defaults` file and save it as `.env`
6. Open the file and set OPS_PUBLIC_URL to the Forwarding address you copied in step 3
```shell
OPS_PUBLIC_URL=https://2f91-62-77-75-198.ngrok-free.app
```
7. Restart the containers
```shell
sudo docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

## Using Azure CLI in workflows: running with local credentials

It is possible to share your local session with the platform for local applications.
To do this, you need to set two environment variables in the `.env` file under the installation folder:
* `OPS_ENABLE_HOST_SESSION=true`: enables sharing of the host session with the platform container.
* `HOST_AZURE_CONFIG_DIR="~/.azure"`: defines the path to the host machine's Azure configuration folder that will be shared with the platform container.
