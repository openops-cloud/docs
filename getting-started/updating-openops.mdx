To update OpenOps to a newer version, you can either use an automatic update script, or perform a manual update.

## Automatic update

1. In the terminal, navigate to your OpenOps installation directory.
2. Run the following command to install the latest available version of OpenOps in the same directory:
    ```shell
    curl -fsS https://openops.sh/install | OPENOPS_INSTALLATION_PATH="$PWD" ${SHELL:-/bin/sh}
    ```
The script will stop all running containers, pull the latest images, and restart OpenOps.

## Manual update

1. Install the `unzip` utility (if not already installed):
    ```shell
    sudo apt install unzip
    ```
2. Navigate to your OpenOps installation directory.
3. Stop all running containers:
    ```shell
    sudo docker compose down
    ```
4. Download and extract the new version:
    ```shell
    curl -OL https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.3.2/openops-dc-0.3.2.zip && \
    unzip -o openops-dc-0.3.2.zip
    ```
    (This code sample refers to a specific version. Don't forget to update it to the version you're installing.)
5. Fetch the new images and restart the application:
    ```shell
    sudo COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
6. (Optional) After confirming that the updated version is running correctly, you can safely clean up older Docker images, including OpenOps images:
    ```shell
    docker image prune -af
    ```
