To update OpenOps to a newer version:
1. Install the `unzip` utility (if not already installed):
    ```shell
    sudo apt install unzip
    ```
2. Navigate to your OpenOps installation directory.
3. Stop all running containers:
    ```shell
    sudo docker compose down
    ```
4. Download and unzip the newer release:
    ```shell
    curl -OL https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.2.5/openops-dc-0.2.5.zip && \
    unzip -o openops-dc-0.2.5.zip
    ```
    (This code sample refers to a specific version. Don't forget to update it to the version you're installing.)
5. Fetch the new images and restart the application:
    ```shell
    sudo COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
