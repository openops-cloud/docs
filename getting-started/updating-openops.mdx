To update OpenOps to a newer version:
1. Navigate to your OpenOps installation directory.
2. Stop all running containers:
    ```shell
    sudo docker compose down
    ```
3. Download and unzip the newer release:
    ```shell
    curl -OL https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/releases/download/0.2.2/openops-dc-0.2.2.zip && \
    unzip -o openops-dc-0.2.2.zip
    ```
    (This code sample refers to a specific version. Don't forget to update it to the version you're installing.)
4. Fetch the new images and restart the application:
    ```shell
    sudo COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=4 docker compose pull -q && sudo docker compose up -d
    ```
