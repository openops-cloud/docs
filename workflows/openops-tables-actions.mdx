OpenOps Tables actions let you update and delete records in your OpenOps tables directly from workflows.

These actions use the default OpenOps Tables user and a database token behind the scenes. You do not need to pass tokens or credentials in the block configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you use OpenOps Tables actions:

- Your OpenOps project has an OpenOps Tables database and tables.
- The default project database token is configured in OpenOps. This token is used automatically by the actions.

## Add or update a record

Use the **Add or Update Record** action to insert a new row or update an existing row in an OpenOps table.

### Properties

- **Table** – Select the target table.
- **Row Primary Key** – Primary key value of the row to update. If the row does not exist, the action creates a new row.
- **Fields to update** – List of table fields and their new values.
- **Round Numeric Values** – When on, numeric values are rounded to the number of decimal places defined by the destination field. When off, the action fails if a value has more decimals than allowed.

### Behavior

1. The action authenticates the default OpenOps Tables user and obtains a database token.
2. It looks up the table by name and loads its fields.
3. It validates that all selected fields exist in the table.
4. If **Round Numeric Values** is on, it rounds numeric inputs to the allowed precision.
5. If **Round Numeric Values** is off and a value has too many decimals, the action fails with an error.
6. It writes the updated fields to the table using the database token.

## Delete a record

Use the **Delete Record** action to remove an existing row from an OpenOps table.

### Properties

- **Table** – Select the target table.
- **Record Primary Key Value** – Primary key value of the row to delete.

### Behavior

1. The action authenticates the default OpenOps Tables user and obtains a database token.
2. It looks up the table by name and loads its fields.
3. It identifies the primary key field.
4. It loads the row with the given primary key value.
5. If no row is found, the action fails with an error.
6. If a row is found, it deletes the row using the database token.
