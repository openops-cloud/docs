OpenOps is an open-source project that welcomes external contributions. In fact, extending OpenOps is fairly straightforward, and this section explains what you need to know to get started.

## OpenOps vs Activepieces

OpenOps is based on [Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/), and contributing to OpenOps is very similar to [contributing to Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/overview).

The main differences are as follows:
* What Activepieces calls "pieces" is called "blocks" in OpenOps.
* Activepieces uses "[piece types](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/piece-definition)" but OpenOps doesn't have the concept of a block type.
* OpenOps doesn't support [creating new triggers](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/create-trigger).
* The `AP_DEV_PIECES` variable inside `packages/server/api/.env` is not used in OpenOps as it builds all its components by default.
* Contributing to OpenOps does not involve publishing your block as an npm package.
