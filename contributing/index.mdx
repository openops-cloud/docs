OpenOps is an [open-source project](https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops) that welcomes external contributions. Extending OpenOps is fairly straightforward, and this section explains what you need to know to get started.

## OpenOps vs Activepieces

OpenOps is based on [Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/), and contributing to OpenOps is very similar to [contributing to Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/overview).

The main differences are as follows:
* What Activepieces calls "pieces" are called "blocks" in OpenOps.
* Activepieces uses "[piece types](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/piece-definition)", but OpenOps doesn't have the concept of block types.
* OpenOps doesnâ€™t support [creating new triggers](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/create-trigger).
* The `AP_DEV_PIECES` variable inside `packages/server/api/.env` isn't used in OpenOps, as it builds all its components by default.
* Contributing to OpenOps doesn't involve publishing your block as an npm package.

## How to contribute

The general process of contributing to OpenOps consists of:
* Scaffolding a new block. The block serves as a container for [actions](/workflow-management/actions/) that users can add to their workflows as steps.
* Implementing authentication for the block. Most non-core OpenOps blocks integrate with third-party services via their APIs, and most APIs require authentication. Implemented authentication allows users to set up [connections](/cloud-access/access-levels-permissions/) and access whatever API your block is built around.
* Scaffolding one or more actions.
* Implementing properties: the configuration settings available to users in the properties pane. Some actions don't have properties, but most do.
* Implementing the logic of the actions: what exactly they execute once all properties are configured.
* Testing the block.
* [Submitting a pull request](https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the main OpenOps repository.

To learn how to quickly create a block that appears in the OpenOps UI and executes a minimal workload, see [Creating a Minimal Block](/contributing/creating-a-minimal-block/).

To learn how to develop a more advanced block that provides full-fledged integration with a third-party service, see [Contributing an Integration](/contributing/contributing-an-integration/).
