Before you start contributing to OpenOps, you need to set up a development environment. While you can set up a local development environment, using GitHub's Codespaces is the easiest way to get started.

## Fork the OpenOps repository

Follow these steps to fork the OpenOps repository:

1. Go to the repository page at https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops.
2. Click the `Fork` button located in the top right corner of the page.
3. When GitHub opens a fork configuration page, accept the default option and click **Create Fork**.

Your fork is now at https://github.com/your_github_username/openops

## Set up Codespaces

In your OpenOps fork, click **\<\> Code**, open the **Codespaces** tab, and click **Create codespace on main**:

GitHub will open a new browser tab with a codespace. Wait for the codespace to be ready.

Review extensions that Codespaces recommends for you. Consider installing **Prettier - Code formatter** and **Jest Runner** extensions.

Codespaces will automatically run `npm start` in the terminal.

In the **Ports** tool window, click **Open in browser** in the **App Frontend** row to open the OpenOps frontend in a new browser tab:

* Password: `12345678`
