Before you start contributing to OpenOps, you need to set up a development environment. While you can set up a local environment, using GitHub Codespaces is the easiest way to get started.

## Fork the OpenOps repository

Follow these steps to fork the OpenOps repository:

1. Go to https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right corner.
3. On the fork configuration page, select the owner to fork under (either your personal account or one of your organizations), then click **Create Fork**.

Your fork will be available at `https://github.com/your_github_account_or_organization/openops`.

## Set up Codespaces

In your OpenOps fork, click **\<\> Code**, open the **Codespaces** tab, and click **Create codespace on main**:

GitHub will open a new browser tab with a codespace. Wait for it to finish setting up.

Review the extensions that Codespaces recommends. Consider installing **Prettier â€“ Code formatter** and **Jest Runner**.

Codespaces will automatically run `npm start` in the terminal.

In the **Ports** tool window, click **Open in browser** in the **App Frontend** row to open the OpenOps frontend in a new tab:

When the OpenOps frontend opens, log in with the following credentials:
* Username: `Dev@openops.com`
* Password: `12345678`

<Warning>
When developing on Codespaces, keep in mind the following:
* GitHub limits Codespaces usage for free accounts when working on a personal fork. To access more Codespaces hours, consider forking to an organization.
* After extended inactivity, Codespaces may lose connectivity between ports used by OpenOps components. To fix this, do one of the following:
  * Run `sh .devcontainer/codespaces.sh` in the terminal.
  * In the **Ports** tab, make the following ports public: `3000`, `3001`, `3005`, `4200`.
</Warning>
