## OpenOps vs Activepieces
OpenOps is based on [Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/), and contributing to OpenOps is very similar to [contributing to Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/overview). What Activepieces calls "pieces" is called "blocks" in OpenOps.

The main differences are as follows:
* Activepieces uses "[piece types](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/piece-definition)" but OpenOps doesn't have the concept of a block type.
* OpenOps doesn't support [creating new triggers](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/building-pieces/create-trigger).
* The `AP_DEV_PIECES` variable inside `packages/server/api/.env` is not used in OpenOps.
* Contributing to OpenOps does not involve publishing your block as an npm package.
