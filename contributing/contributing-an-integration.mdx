[Contributing a minimal block](/contributing/contributing-a-minimal-block/) demonstrated how to use scaffolding and make a block show up in the OpenOps UI. Let's now see how you would create a fully functional integration with a third-party service.

OpenOps integrates with Jira Cloud and Linear, but what if you use a different service for tracking your cloud optimization opportunities? Let's see how you would create a block that integrates with [JetBrains YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/). This involves implementing API key based authentication and designing a couple actions that interact with the [YouTrack API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/devportal/youtrack-rest-api.html).

This is not a step-by-step guide. Instead, it's an overview that highlights prominent parts of the process.

## Scaffolding a new block

To scaffold a new block, you run the following command:

```bash
npm run cli blocks create
```

For a YouTrack integration, you would supply the following information to the CLI:

1. `Block name`: "youtrack" (lowercase).
2. `Package name`: leave blank to use the default name.
3. `Authentication type`: select `Custom (Custom properties)`.
4. `Create opinionated folder structure with stubs for actions, tests, and common service layer`: select `Yes - Create full folder structure with stubs`.

OpenOps generates a full project template inside `packages/blocks/youtrack/`, including `package.json`, TypeScript configuration files, ESLint and Jest configuration files, an entry point for the block at `src/index.ts` and a starter test file at `test/index.test.ts`.

Let's take a closer look at the generated files.

### src/index.ts

`src/index.ts`  is the entry point to the new block. It uses the `createBlock()` function from the OpenOps block framework to create a new block. This function takes a number of arguments, of which the most important ones are:
* `auth`: authentication implementation for the block. It defines which credentials the user needs to specify in your block's [connection](/cloud-access/access-levels-permissions) properties to authenticate with the API that the block integrates with.
* `actions`: an array that contains the actions that the block exposes. The scaffolded version includes a predefined action that allows making a custom API call to the block's API.

```ts
import { createCustomApiCallAction } from '@openops/blocks-common';
import { createBlock, Property } from '@openops/blocks-framework';
import { BlockCategory } from '@openops/shared';
import { youtrackAuth } from './lib/auth';

export const youtrack = createBlock({
  displayName: 'Youtrack',
  auth: youtrackAuth,
  minimumSupportedRelease: '0.20.0',
  logoUrl: 'https://static.openops.com/blocks/youtrack.png',
  authors: [],
  categories: [BlockCategory.FINOPS],
  actions: [
    createCustomApiCallAction({
      baseUrl: () => 'https://api.youtrack.com',
      auth: youtrackAuth,
      additionalProps: {
        documentation: Property.MarkDown({
          value:
            'For more information, visit the [Youtrack API documentation](https://docs.youtrack.com/reference/introduction).',
        }),
      },
    }),
  ],
  triggers: [],
});
```

### src/lib/auth.ts

Scaffolding generates a placeholder authentication implementation in a separate file. It uses a `CustomAuth()` helper function from the OpenOps block framework. The function takes several parameters, of which the most important ones are:
* `props`: an object that defines the inputs necessary to authenticate with the service provider that the block integrates with.
* `validate`: a function for frontend validation of the inputs provided in `props`.

```ts
import { BlockAuth, Property } from '@openops/blocks-framework';

export const youtrackAuth = BlockAuth.CustomAuth({
  authProviderKey: 'youtrack',
  authProviderDisplayName: 'Youtrack',
  authProviderLogoUrl: 'https://static.openops.com/blocks/youtrack.png',
  description: 'Configure your Youtrack connection',
  required: true,
  props: {
    apiKey: Property.SecretText({
      displayName: 'API Key',
      required: true,
    }),
    baseUrl: Property.ShortText({
      displayName: 'Base URL',
      description: 'The base URL for Youtrack API',
      required: true,
    }),
  },
  validate: async ({ auth }) => {
    // Add validation logic here
    return { valid: true };
  },
});
```

### Project files

OpenOps uses [Nx](https://nx.dev/) as its build system, and `project.json` is the Nx project file that defines how the new block is built, tested, and linted in an Nx workspace. It sets the source root, output path, TypeScript config, package entry points, and assets, and declares executors for build (`@nx/js:tsc`), test (`@nx/jest:jest`), and lint (`@nx/eslint:lint`).

```json
{
  "name": "blocks-youtrack",
  "$schema": "../../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "sourceRoot": "packages/blocks/youtrack/src",
  "projectType": "library",
  "tags": [],
  "targets": {
    "build": {
      "executor": "@nx/js:tsc",
      "outputs": ["{options.outputPath}"],
      "options": {
        "outputPath": "dist/packages/blocks/youtrack",
        "tsConfig": "packages/blocks/youtrack/tsconfig.lib.json",
        "packageJson": "packages/blocks/youtrack/package.json",
        "main": "packages/blocks/youtrack/src/index.ts",
        "assets": ["packages/blocks/youtrack/*.md"],
        "buildableProjectDepsInPackageJsonType": "dependencies",
        "updateBuildableProjectDepsInPackageJson": true
      }
    },
    "test": {
      "executor": "@nx/jest:jest",
      "outputs": ["{workspaceRoot}/coverage/{projectRoot}"],
      "options": {
        "jestConfig": "packages/blocks/youtrack/jest.config.ts"
      }
    },
    "lint": {
      "executor": "@nx/eslint:lint",
      "outputs": ["{options.outputFile}"]
    }
  }
}
```

`package.json` is a minimal metadata file declaring the block's name and version within the Nx workspace. Unlike typical npm packages and as opposed to the Activepieces extension practices, this file isn't meant for publication to the npm registry. Instead, it mainly helps Nx identify the project and marks the block as a versioned unit inside the larger repository.

```json
{
  "name": "@openops/block-youtrack",
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

### Test files

`test/index.test.ts` is a stub Jest test fixture that includes a few sample tests for the block. Tests in this fixture can be executed by running `nx test blocks-youtrack`.

```ts
import { youtrack } from '../src/index';

describe('block declaration tests', () => {
  test('should return block with correct authentication', () => {
    expect(youtrack.auth).toMatchObject({
      type: 'CUSTOM_AUTH',
      required: true,
      authProviderKey: 'youtrack',
      authProviderDisplayName: 'Youtrack',
      authProviderLogoUrl: 'https://static.openops.com/blocks/youtrack.png',
    });
  });

  test('should return block with correct number of actions', () => {
    expect(Object.keys(youtrack.actions()).length).toBe(1);
    expect(youtrack.actions()).toMatchObject({
      custom_api_call: {
        name: 'custom_api_call',
        requireAuth: true,
      },
    });
  });
});
```

There's also a Jest configuration file, `jest.config.ts`, that inherits shared settings from OpenOps' Jest preset, references a TypeScript config file, defines recognized file extensions and specifies where to store code coverage reports:

```ts
export default {
  displayName: 'blocks-youtrack',
  preset: '../../../jest.preset.js',
  setupFiles: ['../../../jest.env.js'],
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.[tj]s$': ['ts-jest', { tsconfig: '<rootDir>/tsconfig.spec.json' }],
  },
  moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'js', 'html'],
  coverageDirectory: '../../../coverage/packages/blocks/youtrack',
};
```

### TypeScript configuration files

Scaffolding generates three TypeScript configuration files: `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.lib.json`, and `tsconfig.spec.json`

`tsconfig.json` is the base config for the block. It extends the workspace's root `tsconfig.base.json` and enforces strict compiler options but doesn't include any source files directly. Instead, it references the other two config files, serving as an entry point for both:

```json
{
  "extends": "../../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true
  },
  "files": [],
  "include": [],
  "references": [
    {
      "path": "./tsconfig.lib.json"
    },
    {
      "path": "./tsconfig.spec.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

`tsconfig.lib.json` applies to the block's source code. It outputs compiled files to `dist/out-tsc`, generates type declarations, and includes only non-test TypeScript files under `src/`:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "../../../dist/out-tsc",
    "declaration": true,
    "types": ["node"]
  },
  "exclude": ["jest.config.ts", "src/**/*.spec.ts", "src/**/*.test.ts"],
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"]
}
```

`tsconfig.spec.json` is tailored for testing. It includes test and declaration files and sets up Jest typings:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "../../../dist/out-tsc",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "types": ["jest", "node"]
  },
  "include": [
    "jest.config.ts",
    "src/**/*.test.ts",
    "src/**/*.spec.ts",
    "src/**/*.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

### Other files

`.eslintrc.json` defines JavaScript and TypeScript linting behavior for the block, extending the OpenOps repository's root ESLint configuration. The `overrides` section provides placeholders for block-specific linting rules in case you feel like introducing them.

`README.md` stubs out documentation for the block.

## Post-scaffolding cleanup

OpenOps may alter the spelling of your block's display name when running scaffolding, so you may want to review this and run search and replace if needed. With YouTrack, it didn't use the proper casing for the product name, using "Youtrack" instead of "YouTrack".

Note that OpenOps also generates a stub logo URL at the static.openops.com domain, which doesn't exist. To see your product's logo in the OpenOps UI during development, consider replacing the stub logo URL with a URL on a server that you control. For example, for YouTrack, the https://static.openops.com/blocks/youtrack.png stub URL can be replaced with a [live YouTrack logo URL](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/YouTrack_icon.png). Alternatively, you can keep the stub as is and ask OpenOps to upload your logo when you open a PR.

## Implementing authentication (and getting a connection for free)

Now that you have a block, you could get right to building its actions. However, unless your block interacts with a publicly accessible API, you need to provide the user with a way to authenticate with the API that your block is built upon.

If you open your OpenOps instance now and try to create a new connection, you'll see that YouTrack is already listed as an available connection type.

![Your action in OpenOps UI](/images/contributing/youtrack-connection-type.png)

Theres no additional effort required to enable configuring connections: as soon as you have an authentication it enables itself as soon as an auth configuration is present.

That's because scaffolding generated a placeholder authentication implementation. You'll now need to implement the actual authentication logic in the `src/lib/auth.ts` file.
