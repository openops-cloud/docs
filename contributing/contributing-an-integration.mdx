[Contributing a minimal block](/contributing/contributing-a-minimal-block/) demonstrated how to use scaffolding and make a block show up in the OpenOps UI. Let's now create another block - this time, it's going to be a fully functional integration with a third-party service.

OpenOps integrates with Jira Cloud and Linear, but what if you use a different service for tracking your cloud optimization opportunities? Let's create a block that integrates with [JetBrains YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/). This will involve implementing API key based authentication, designing actions that interact with the YouTrack API, and writing basic tests.

Before you start, [set up your development environment](/contributing/development-environment/).

## Scaffold a new block

Run the following command to scaffold a new block:

```bash
npm run cli blocks create
```

Supply the following information to the CLI:

1. `Block name`: enter "youtrack" (lowercase) as the block name.
2. `Package name`: leave blank to use the default name.
3. `Authentication type`: select `Secret (API key)`.
4. `Create opinionated folder structure with stubs for actions, tests, and common service layer`: select `Yes - Create full folder structure with stubs`.

OpenOps will generate a full project template inside `packages/blocks/youtrack/`, including `package.json`, TypeScript configuration files, ESLint and Jest configuration files, an entry point for the block at `src/index.ts` and a starter test file at `test/index.test.ts`.

The `src/index.ts` file should contain the following code:

```ts
import { createCustomApiCallAction } from '@openops/blocks-common';
import { createBlock, Property } from '@openops/blocks-framework';
import { BlockCategory } from '@openops/shared';
import { youtrackAuth } from './lib/auth';

export const youtrack = createBlock({
  displayName: 'Youtrack',
  auth: youtrackAuth,
  minimumSupportedRelease: '0.20.0',
  logoUrl: 'https://static.openops.com/blocks/youtrack.png',
  authors: [],
  categories: [BlockCategory.FINOPS],
  actions: [
    createCustomApiCallAction({
      baseUrl: () => 'https://api.youtrack.com',
      auth: youtrackAuth,
      additionalProps: {
        documentation: Property.MarkDown({
          value:
            'For more information, visit the [Youtrack API documentation](https://docs.youtrack.com/reference/introduction).',
        }),
      },
    }),
  ],
  triggers: [],
});
```

Since you've chosen to create a block with a secret authentication type, the generated code includes the `src/lib/auth.ts` file with placeholder authentication logic:

```ts
import { BlockAuth } from '@openops/blocks-framework';

export const youtrackAuth = BlockAuth.SecretAuth({
  displayName: 'API Key',
  required: true,
  authProviderKey: 'youtrack',
  authProviderDisplayName: 'Youtrack',
  authProviderLogoUrl: 'https://static.openops.com/blocks/youtrack.png',
  description: '',
});
```

## Fix the product name and logo

When generating, OpenOps didn't use the proper casing for the product name, and now is a good time for a case-sensitive search of "Youtrack" and replacing it with "YouTrack" in the generated code.

It has also generated logo URLs at static.openops.com that don't exist. Let's replace https://static.openops.com/blocks/youtrack.png with a live YouTrack logo URL, which is https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/YouTrack_icon.png
