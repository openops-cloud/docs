OpenOps can use a large language model (LLM) of your choice to help you with:
* Generating CLI commands for AWS, Azure, and GCP
* Writing SQL queries for AWS Athena, BigQuery, Snowflake, and Databricks

You can do all this right inside the workflow editor, without switching context.

## Enabling AI assistance

OpenOps doesn't lock you into a specific AI model: instead, you **bring your own AI keys** and [connect them to OpenOps](/ai-assistance/llm-connections).

Supported LLMs include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Generative AI, Groq, Mistral, Perplexity, xAI Grok, and more.

## Using AI assistance

### Generating commands and queries

Whenever you work with an [action](/workflow-management/actions) that requires writing a CLI command or SQL query, you'll see the **Generate with AI** command next to the relevant property in the action's properties pane:

When you click **Generate with AI**, use the AI chat window to prompt for the outcome of the target command or query, and your LLM will generate it for you:

### Generating code steps

When existing no-code actions are not a good fit for your workflow, you can use AI assistance to generate JavaScript code for custom code steps.

In the properties pane of your **Code** step, click **Generate with AI**. When the AI chat window opens, enter a prompt, providing details about the task you want to accomplish. The AI will generate a code snippet that respects the format that the code step expects. Click **Use code** to insert the generated code into the step's **Source Code** field:

Test the step to ensure that the generated code works as expected. If it doesn't on the first try, you can refine your prompt, explicitly provide the output of the previous step, and generate a new code snippet.

### AI chatbot

The AI assistant chat becomes available at the bottom of the left sidebar in every OpenOps view:

You can use it to ask questions about what you can do with OpenOps.
