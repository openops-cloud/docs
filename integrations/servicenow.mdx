OpenOps provides built-in actions to automate ServiceNow record management. These actions allow you to create, update, retrieve, and list ServiceNow records as part of your workflow automation.

## Prerequisites
- ServiceNow instance with API access
- ServiceNow account credentials and permissions for target tables
- OpenOps platform access

## Available Actions

- **Create Record**: Add a new record to a ServiceNow table
- **Update Record**: Update an existing record by its identifier
- **Get Record**: Retrieve a single record by its identifier
- **List Records**: Query records from a table with filters

## Setup Steps

1. **Configure ServiceNow Connection**
   - Go to **Integrations > ServiceNow** in OpenOps
   - Enter your ServiceNow instance URL and credentials
   - Test the connection to verify access

2. **Add ServiceNow Action to a Workflow**
   - In workflow builder, select "Add Action"
   - Choose the ServiceNow action you want (Create, Update, Get, or List Record)
   - Configure required fields: specify the table, input the record data or filters

### Example: Create a ServiceNow Incident

```json
{
  "action": "servicenow.createRecord",
  "table": "incident",
  "fields": {
    "short_description": "Automation-triggered Incident",
    "priority": "2",
    "category": "network"
  }
}
```

### Example: List Records With Filter

```json
{
  "action": "servicenow.listRecords",
  "table": "incident",
  "filter": {
    "state": "New",
    "priority": "1"
  },
  "limit": 10
}
```

## Field Handling
- Supported field types include string, number, date, reference, choices, and booleans
- Use exact ServiceNow field names as keys when specifying input data
- For reference fields, provide the sys_id of the target record

## Validation
- Successful action returns record data from ServiceNow
- On failure, OpenOps will return an error message with status details

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure credentials have correct ServiceNow API permissions
- Double-check table and field names for typos
- For connectivity errors, confirm the ServiceNow API endpoint is accessible from OpenOps
- Refer to action logs in OpenOps for detailed error responses
