This page explains how to integrate ServiceNow request actions with OpenOps workflows, enabling automated IT Service Management (ITSM) operations in your organization.

## Prerequisites

- ServiceNow account with API access
- OpenOps environment with integration permissions
- ServiceNow instance URL, credentials, and access token

## Available Actions

OpenOps provides the following ServiceNow request actions for use in your workflows:

- `get_requests`: Retrieve existing service requests from ServiceNow
- `upsert_request`: Create or update a service request (upsert)
- `delete_request`: Remove a service request from ServiceNow

## Example Usage

### 1. Retrieve Requests

```yaml
- action: servicenow.get_requests
  inputs:
    query: "state=Pending Approval"
```
_This step fetches all requests in the state 'Pending Approval'._

### 2. Upsert a Request

```yaml
- action: servicenow.upsert_request
  inputs:
    request_id: "REQ0012345"
    fields:
      short_description: "Cloud resource request update"
      priority: "2"
```
_This either updates the existing request REQ0012345 or creates it if it doesn't exist._

### 3. Delete a Request

```yaml
- action: servicenow.delete_request
  inputs:
    request_id: "REQ0012345"
```
_This removes the specified service request from ServiceNow._

## Validation

- Check the workflow run summary in OpenOps for action output and confirmation.
- Confirm changes in your ServiceNow instance directly for critical operations.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure ServiceNow API credentials are correct and have the required permissions
- Verify the ServiceNow instance URL is accessible from the OpenOps environment
- Review the error message in the workflow run for additional context
