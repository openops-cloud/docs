This page explains how to use the ServiceNow request actionsâ€”deletion, retrieval, and upsertâ€”for request items within OpenOps workflows. Intended for DevOps and FinOps users configuring automation with the ServiceNow integration.

## Prerequisites
- OpenOps platform access with admin privileges
- ServiceNow integration configured ([see README](/README.md))
- ServiceNow instance URL and credentials (API access enabled)
- API credentials (with permissions for request operations)

## Supported Actions

| Action      | Description                                                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Delete      | Removes a ServiceNow request item by its identifier                   |
| Retrieve    | Fetches details for a single request item, or batch by filter/ID      |
| Upsert      | Creates or updates a request item by ID or defined matching criteria  |

## Using ServiceNow Request Actions in Workflows

Below are sample usage patterns for each action type. Substitute placeholders with your values.

### Delete Request Item Example

```yaml
- action: serviceNow.deleteRequest
  with:
    requestItemId: "<REQUEST_ITEM_ID>"
```

### Retrieve Request Item Example

```yaml
- action: serviceNow.getRequest
  with:
    requestItemId: "<REQUEST_ITEM_ID>"
# OR: fetch multiple by filter
- action: serviceNow.getRequests
  with:
    filter: "state=Active"
    limit: 10
```

### Upsert Request Item Example

```yaml
- action: serviceNow.upsertRequest
  with:
    requestItemId: "<REQUEST_ITEM_ID>"   # Omit to create new
    data:
      short_description: "Example request"
      priority: 2
```

## Validation
- Success: Action returns the ServiceNow item JSON or deletion confirmation
- Failure: Action error with HTTP status and ServiceNow error message (check authentication, permissions, or input validity)

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure integration credentials remain active
- Confirm user has permissions for request API endpoints
- Inspect workflow logs for HTTP error details
