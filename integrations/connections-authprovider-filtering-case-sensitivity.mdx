## Overview
Connections filtering by authentication provider (authProvider) in the OpenOps API is now case-insensitive. API requests filtering connections on the `authProvider` parameter will return matching results regardless of letter casing in the provided value.

This change applies to all endpoints that support filtering by `authProvider`, including integrations with Azure OpenAI and other cloud platforms.

## Impact
- Filter values for `authProvider` no longer require exact casing.
- Improves consistency and reduces issues with provider matching in API queries.
- Existing integrations using different casing (e.g., `AzureOpenAI`, `azureopenai`, `azureOpenAI`) will now behave identically.

## API Filtering Example

### Request Example
```http
GET /api/v1/connections?authProvider=AZUREOPENAI
```

This request will return all connections using the `AzureOpenAI` provider, regardless of whether they were created with a different casing in the `authProvider` field.

### Request Example (Mixed Case)
```http
GET /api/v1/connections?authProvider=AzureOpenAI
```

This request returns the same results as above.

## Usage Notes
- No action is needed for existing connections or workflows. All queries are now normalized for case.
- This behavior applies to all integrations, not limited to Azure OpenAI.

## Troubleshooting
- If your connection queries previously failed due to case mismatch, simply retry the query. Results are now consistent across casing variants.
