This guide shows how to generate an AWS Console link that opens an SSM Automation runbook (document) with optional version and parameters pre-filled. You can share this link in approvals or notifications (for example, Slack) so operators can execute the runbook in the AWS Console.

Prerequisites

- An AWS connection in OpenOps.
- The name of the SSM Automation runbook (document) you want to open.

Steps

1) Add the action
- In the workflow editor, add a new step and choose AWS.
- Select Generate Runbook Execution Link.

2) Configure properties
- Region (optional): If left empty, uses the region from your AWS connection.
- Owner (required): Select where the runbook is owned (Amazon, Owned by me, Shared with me, Public, Third Party, or All runbooks). This helps you find the document by source.
- Runbook: Enter the runbook name (for example, AWS-RestartEC2Instance).
- Version (optional): Specify a document version (for example, 3).
- Parameters (optional): Provide key-value pairs for the runbook inputs. Values may be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.

3) Use the output
- The action returns an object with a link field. Use this URL in follow-up steps (for example, include it in a Slack message).

Behavior details

- Link format: https://{region}.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/automation/execute/{runbook}?region={region}# ...
- Document version: When provided, the link includes #documentVersion={version}& so that additional parameters can follow.
- Parameters encoding:
  - Empty, null, or blank values are omitted.
  - Arrays of primitives are joined with a comma and space, then URL-encoded.
  - Objects or arrays with objects are JSON-serialized and URL-encoded.
  - Parameter names and values are URL-encoded.

Examples

- Only region and runbook:
  - Output link: https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/automation/execute/AWS-RestartEC2Instance?region=us-west-2#

- With version:
  - Output link: https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/automation/execute/My-Runbook?region=ap-south-1#documentVersion=3&

- With parameters (special characters encoded):
  - Output link: https://eu-west-3.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/automation/execute/RB?region=eu-west-3#key%20with%20space=value%2Fwith%3Fspecial%26chars

Tips

- Combine this action with Slack Request Action to guide an operator to the Console and capture their response.
- Use dynamic values for Parameters to pass context from earlier steps (for example, instance IDs).
